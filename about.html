<h3>About</h3>

<p align="justify"> The Cutebot Calendar is a comic that updates one panel per day, telling the story of some little robots doing their best to find their place in a world they've only recently become aware of.</p>
    
<p align="justify">It is drawn by Matthew McGuigan (he/him), a cartoonist from Amiskwaciwâskahikan / Edmonton. He started drawing it in 2017 as an exercise/perk for his Patreon supporters. At that time the goal was to just draw a robot with an encouraging message for every day of the year, with the hope of eventually creating something like a daily flip calendar. This format persisted for several years. In <a href="/cc/2021-03-16.html">2021</a> some recurring characters and a loose story were introduced as an experiment, with each day attempting to be a self-contained comic, sometimes featuring multiple panels. In <a href="/cc/2024-04-01.html">2024</a> it took its current form with the goal of telling a more specific long-form story one panel at a time. Due to this format the storytelling is often improvisational.</p> <p align="justify">This is unlikely to be the best way to make a comic but hopefully it is enjoyable all the same.<p align="justify">The html for this website was coded/designed by Matthew, however a big thank-you is owed to dear friend Yaroslav Veremenko for coding assistance as well as for custom scripts used to automate the generation of static pages, and any other thing that Matthew couldn't figure out (which was a lot).</p></p><p align="justify">Matthew works full-time in music retail but you can help him consider not doing that by supporting his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mattmcguigan">Patreon</a> or via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/mattmcguigan">Ko-fi</a>. Regardless of this he is very appreciative of your taking the time to read this.</p> 	<br>
