<h3>About</h3>

<p align="left"> The Cutebot Calendar is a daily comic that updates one panel at a time, telling the story of some little robots doing their best to find their place in a world they've only recently become aware of.</p>
    
<p align="left">It is drawn by Matthew McGuigan (he/him), a cartoonist from Edmonton/Amiskwaciw√¢skahikan. He started drawing it in 2017 as an exercise/perk for his Patreon supporters. At that time the goal was to just draw a robot with an encouraging message every day of the year, with the hope of eventually creating something like a daily flip calendar. This format persisted for several years. In <a href="/cc/2021-03-16.html">2021</a> some recurring characters and a loose story were introduced as an experiment, with each day attempting to be a self-contained comic to some degree. In <a href="/cc/2024-04-01.html">2024</a> it took its current form with the goal of telling a more specific long-form story one panel at a time. Due to this format the storytelling is often improvisational.</p> <p align="left">This is unlikely to be the best way to make a comic but hopefully it is enjoyable all the same.</p><p align="left">Matthew works full-time in music retail but you can help him consider not doing that by supporting his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mattmcguigan">Patreon</a>. Regardless of this he is very appreciative of your taking the time to read this.</p>
