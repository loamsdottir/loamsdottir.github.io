2023-01-19 we are always starting something... ...sometimes it is a good thing... ...and sometimes it is something else
2023-01-20 I am mostly just trying to figure out what is going on
2023-01-21 I hope I can always be an ongoing process
2023-01-22 there are tasks to do!! I will attempt them!!!
2023-01-23 sometimes I just forget the things that make me happy... I guess it's a nice little surprise when I  remember, though
2023-01-24 communication is difficult!!! tea is much easier
2023-01-25 even if it is for a thing that is just for you it is okay to get some help
2023-01-26 thank you... it is the result of, um, several iterations! you have a wonderful design!
2023-01-27 today I am in development some functions may not execute as intended
2023-01-28 how come some days just feel like a Big Deal for no reason? might be the Anxiety
2023-01-29 I miss how I used to function ...but maybe I am just handling more complex processes now
2023-01-30 listen!! I am trying really hard! but it will not be obvious, probably!!!
2023-01-31 it is nice to meet someone else who is also just a little guy
2023-02-01 oh, I see so we're doing this whole THING again, huh!
2023-02-02 I guess I start over a lot that's okay
2023-02-03 gotta get these dang ideas out of my head before I start realizing that they are imperfect
2023-02-04 yeah, I have some difficult stuff to get through today I am just marinating about it first
2023-02-05 hoo boy I can tell we're gonna be WORKIN' today
2023-02-06 I am allowing myself a bit of denial that today is happening as a little TREAT
2023-02-07 oh, do not mind me I am just feeling a little  CURSED by SENTIENCE today
2023-02-08 I think I am probably doing this wrong but it is still a big improvement from NOT doing it
2023-02-09 I want to be DONE having THINGS to do but that usually means I gotta DO stuff first
2023-02-10 I would just like someone to appreciate what it took to get me here today it was a lot
2023-02-11 o-oh ok ok ok heeeeere we go, here we go
2023-02-12 today our special guest is Garbage Bot who has come to share their feelings on the state of things aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2023-02-13 some days I just gotta SCOOT 'cause sometimes that's easier than THINKIN'
2023-02-14 everyone  better  WATCH OUT I'm comin' atcha with REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS
2023-02-15 gosh we perceivin' things AGAIN today?
2023-02-16 the world is lucky to have you today and they might not even know think I'll go out and remind 'em
2023-02-17 do not forget to give yourself credit for being cute today despite everything
2023-02-18 some days that's just a real long way to go
2023-02-19 maybe more...?! I think I am doing pretty good by at least one metric...
2023-02-20 sometimes it is hard to know if you are balancing on just one bad thing happening until the thing happens
2023-02-21  I do not require a 'function' to function!! I'm just here doin' my thing!!
2023-02-22 today I am rated 'A' for Anxious and Adorable ...and, uh, Alreadytime-fora-nap
2023-02-23 I am ready to do some NONSENSE today
2023-02-24 time to do a little SHIMMY to help fend off the BAD TIMES 
2023-02-25 you have a ME! oh! today we have a You! that is very  good!
2023-02-26 listen UP! I'm just... HERE and I have NO IDEA what is going on! so, same drill as  yesterday, ok??
2023-02-27 'Today' is back! this time, featuring CIRCUMSTANCES
2023-02-28 please excuse me I just need a little help appreciating myself today nonverbal high-five interactions are acceptable
2023-03-01 it is never too late who even knows what time it is I mean
2023-03-02 Hey, you made it here, too!
2023-03-03 I really hope that there is someone out there who finds my constant confusion endearing
2023-03-04 oh  glorious day, please grant us an ok time
2023-03-05 I have no idea what I am doing!! oh, thank GOODNESS
2023-03-06 I am just a LITTLE thing but I am BIG PROUD!!
2023-03-07 I have put something on my head to make today feel a little special I am hoping it will effectively combat the Emptiness Inside
2023-03-08 none can deny the inscrutable, intrinsic value of a true companion
2023-03-09 we could perhaps reach a compromise of decibels IS IT SO WRONG TO BE "OVERLY DECLARATIVE" WHEN EXPRESSING HOW COOL I THINK MY FRIENDS ARE??
2023-03-10 sometimes I wonder if others see me as a waste of time... ...but like, a REALLY GOOD waste of time
2023-03-11 shucks today I'm just full-on BOOPED
2023-03-12 you  know, I did pretty good YESTERDAY so I'm just gonna ride that feeling for TODAY, thank you very MUCH
2023-03-13 so much STUFF to DO today  and even more stuff to WORRY about 
2023-03-14 do not go anywhere without your Implement Of Significance  today, mine is a spoon
2023-03-15 preparing for potential 'uh-oh's today got a bunch of 'Well Ok Then' and preemptive 'NOPE's at the ready
2023-03-16 got a  SPECIAL  PROJECT for today that involves chores, hot chocolate, and minimal crying the SEQUENCE of these activities will be a SURPRISE for EVERYONE 
2023-03-17 I may have a bit of MISPLACED confidence today but  I promise it just comes from some ACTUAL GROWTH in an unrelated area
2023-03-18 every time I do routine maintenance I find myself having to make revisions to this dang thing
2023-03-19 ooh, I have discovered a new thing I enjoy! ...my goodness do I hope it meets the approval of my peers
2023-03-20 WAIT a second, today's already started, and I'm... getting THROUGH it?? ...someone better be giving me a PRESENT when we're done
2023-03-21 I am proud and grateful to know that I  am but one of MANY Little Weirdos out there in the world
2023-03-22 who's ready to prioritize the ever-present desire for more sleep as a means to rationalize the avoidance of stressful commitments?? ooh, ooh!
2023-03-23 I have allocated sufficient capacity for approximately three 'OOF's today I MAY not accept responsibility for my actions if this is exceeded
2023-03-24 hmm, I may have miscalculated my interest in being productive today
2023-03-25 I would appreciate a REPRIEVE from most THINGS ...and STUFF too
2023-03-26 I believe my ambitions are REASONABLE all I want is to FINISH whatever I need to finish so that everyone leaves me ALONE
2023-03-27 I want to have one of those "WHO DID THIS  oh, it was me" moments except for it to be about a GOOD thing
2023-03-28 I am here just to BE, not to DO anything and it is still a GOOD way to use my TIME
2023-03-29 I expect GREAT  THINGS from this NAP... ...GREAT THINGS
2023-03-30 I'm SORRY but whatever stimulus you have for me is going to have to WAIT until I am done processing LAST week's stimulus ...it is milk... PROCESSING
2023-03-31 we did a good job getting here, didn't we?
2023-04-01 VERY excited for my weekend plans of lowvolume solitude
2023-04-02 not sure if it is an EFFORT day today trying to DECIDE is already a lot of WORK
2023-04-03 simply FULFILLING an obligation is not super motivating, I think knowing that I can SLACK OFF once the obligation is fulfilled, however...
2023-04-04 I am FILLED with an incomprehensible POWER!... like, please help I do NOT  know what to do with this energy
2023-04-05 I have worked very HARD to be sufficiently STABLE today
2023-04-06 sometimes making plans is a MISTAKE, but that's ok: I can still enjoy a cancelled plan  ...sometimes even more than the plan itself
2023-04-07 today is either going very WELL or very POORLY either, way somehow I've already made it PART-WAY through, so I'll take that as a WIN
2023-04-08 you can give a 'big' reward for a  'small' accomplishment it is  surprisingly NOT a big deal at all, I promise!!
2023-04-09 the PROBLEM is that I am always too busy to NOTICE when I am working HARD and then I am too TIRED to remember how hard I worked
2023-04-10 ok world, I am trying extra hard today!! and I would really like for it to make a bit of a difference, please!
2023-04-11 come, friend: let us COPE  our way healthily through this day TOGETHER
2023-04-12 time for a break! ... and probably some guilt! ... oh, woops
2023-04-13 today was tomorrow just yesterday and now I gotta deal with it??
2023-04-14 it is reassuring to see other things that keep going maybe we are all reassuring each other like that
2023-04-15 maybe I can surprise myself today by doing a Normal Thing
2023-04-16 trying really hard to have a SINGLE thought but I always seem to get UNWANTED COMBO deals
2023-04-17 I figured if I was tired of OUTPUTTING stuff I should rest with some INPUT but it turns out PUTTING stuff somewhere either way STILL makes me TIRED
2023-04-18 gosh it sure is tiring to be constantly resisting the urge to spice things up today
2023-04-19 once again I am compelled to offer TEA in the absence of COHERENT THOUGHTS ...I can just tell you about MY day, then
2023-04-20 oh, that LAST little chunk showing up  on my battery indicator? that is RESERVED  for some VERY IMPORTANT 'Being Useless' time at the  end of the day
2023-04-21 who  scheduled TODAY for right NOW  when I CLEARLY still need an extension on YESTERDAY
2023-04-22 feeling very compressed today it is probably just the Crushing Responsibilities again
2023-04-23 hey there ...oh,  me? just  VIBIN' and SURVIVIN', as usual
2023-04-24 I am PREPARED for today, but GOSH I am not READY
2023-04-25 gosh the STIMULI are hittin' real HARD today
2023-04-26 rootin' for today to NOT be a GARBAGE
2023-04-27 sometimes for everyone's SAFETY it is important to demarcate the boundaries of your VIBE 
2023-04-28 ...ah,  yes, the Terrors  what is this familiar feeling I am starting the day with...?
2023-04-29 let's DO this
2023-04-30 if I ever had a full battery, by golly I'd be formidable
2023-05-01 I'm ok, just waiting for Today to make the  first move
2023-05-02 this is all I GOT it's just me, but it's still SOMETHIN'
2023-05-03 commitments are sacred, so I do not enter into them LIGHTLY but I DO promise you, I WILL come back when you have boiled 
2023-05-04 this was entirely expected and yet: no umbrella! huh!
2023-05-05 I just think I deserve a little TREAT! ya  know! for  GETTIN' BY!!
2023-05-06 it might be impressive, but trust me when I say that I have NO idea how I got here
2023-05-07 being lazy can take a lot of work, but it's usually worth the effort
2023-05-08 ah, glorious Sunrise, harbinger of forgotten deadlines and  dreadful consciousness be gentle with me as I have no clue what is going on
2023-05-09 I have painstakingly prepared a PLAN for today I'm not very GOOD at planning so it's not a VERY GOOD PLAN, but it's SOMETHIN'
2023-05-10 WHO knows WHAT today brings??? SERIOUSLY I would like to KNOW 'cause I'm just kinda HANGIN' ON over here
2023-05-11 I'm gonna SUSTAIN myself out of SPITE and we'll see where things go from there
2023-05-12 may I also partake of  this patch of dirt yeah just give me five more minutes
2023-05-13 doin' GREAT
2023-05-14 what's on the AGENDA for today... ah, yes: PROBLEMS
2023-05-15 we are gonna do SO GOOD today and maybe only cry a LITTLE bit
2023-05-16 Here I am!! puttin' the 'FUN' in FUNCTIONAL
2023-05-17 I am GOOD just not always DOING good
2023-05-18 oh gosh I didn't prepare for things going WELL today
2023-05-19 GOSH sometimes thinkin' about the future really BUMS ME OUT so I just gotta be PRESENT for a bit
2023-05-20 pretty sure I saw some worthwhile stimuli somewhere over the horizon
2023-05-21 OH HEY you know you don't gotta do anything special for me to think that you are pretty great
2023-05-22 looks like it's gonna be another day of "Rolling With It" and you know, I think I am a good shape for that sort of thing
2023-05-23 it is another day of YOU! I suppose I can be convinced that this is a good thing
2023-05-24 just KEEPIN' ON is somehow both the EASIER and HARDERthing to do when I feel like GIVIN' UP  so here I am!!!
2023-05-25 SO, who's ready for more ME today?? 'CAUSE I'M NOT
2023-05-26 y'know what, falling flat on my FACE speaks to a level of CONFIDENCE which I MIGHT choose to be PROUD of
2023-05-27 well shucks, I've gone and BEWILDERED myself and the day's just BEGUN
2023-05-28 TOMORROW is full of TIME to get things DONE but it has a nasty habit of turning into TODAY
2023-05-29 I've only got my lowlevel coping skills available today but I'm gonna look GOOD while I'm usin' them
2023-05-30 I think I am just OK but gosh it was a hard-won battle to convince myself of it
2023-05-31 perhaps today we will encounter an item of GREAT POWER
2023-06-01 no one must know that I am not feeling completely fabulous today
2023-06-02 trying to get the most difficult thing done FIRST so that I can enjoy the rest of the day but then the whole day ends up BEING the most difficult part??
2023-06-03 I promise to start functioning normally once I find a place to plug this stupid thing in
2023-06-04 I just think that everyone did a good job getting here
2023-06-05 it maybe was not the BIGGEST stumbling block but I got over it!!!
2023-06-06 things are 'Normal' today ...which is to say that they could be much IMPROVED
2023-06-07 I can't quite manage BRUTE force solutions but I can do CUTE FORCE
2023-06-08 oh gosh, I'm HERE I don't always plan for this
2023-06-09 I find  COMFORT in not knowing what the HECK I am doing because I  am assuredly NOT ALONE
2023-06-10 oh WOW life is just a LOT, isn't it
2023-06-11 I am PROUD of my functionality today it occassionally gets me places!!
2023-06-12 I know Reality is just kinda doing its own thing I just wanna be a PART of it
2023-06-13 I'm so good at distracting myself sometimes I don't realize how tiring an activity it is
2023-06-14 OOPS I am unavoidably MYSELF
2023-06-15 NEXT UP on my list of things I do NOT wish to engage with: it's.... TODAY!
2023-06-16 I think we will ALWAYS be, like, getting through... "it" ... I think that's kinda nice
2023-06-17 I feel like I got pretty BASIC expectations of stuff, but it also still feels like a LOT??
2023-06-18 today does not need to be GOOD but I hope it is kind
2023-06-19 I am READY for NONSENSE but I would PREFER... something else
2023-06-20 do not despair! none of us are any good at this stuff and somehow things keep on going
2023-06-21 NEVER STOP LOVING YOURSELF
2023-06-22 sometimes I only got one NICE THING to give away in a day ...sometimes I gotta save it for ME
2023-06-23 sometimes you are a resting place for someone, and you don't even know it
2023-06-24 I know it changes VERY LITTLE but I need everyone to know that I am VERY SLEEPY today!!!
2023-06-25 trying out a NEW thing where I TRUST myself not to combust into a conflagration of incendiary anxiety
2023-06-26 I am probably due to think better of myself today
2023-06-27 how I admire the simplistic complexities of being of NATURE ... what mystifying ELEGANCE and GRACE
2023-06-28 today seems like a GOOD DAY to create a buffer of accomplishments to sustain me through the crushing wave of ENNUI in the evening forecast
2023-06-29 I'm gettin' through today but gosh I'm looking forward to clearing my memory cache at the end of it
2023-06-30 sometimes when someone remembers me I think "do I deserve it" but I also think: "please don't forget"
2023-07-01 today I suggest offering compassion to a small creature ...the small creature  could be me
2023-07-02 I got THINGS to do, but snuggles take priority
2023-07-03 I may not have PLANNED to be ME, but I will certainly not apologize for it ... (sorry)
2023-07-04 oh I would like to recalibrate today's volume, please, so that everything is not shouting at me
2023-07-05 sometimes I worry whether I'm working HARD ENOUGH until I remember how exhausting it is to be ME
2023-07-06 MY TURN to be NOISY today!!!
2023-07-07 hey you got my permission to go bananas in  your preferred method while I maintain a safe distance ok but I don't even think I got bananas in me today
2023-07-08 today I'm gonna trust that my usefulness does NOT determine my WORTH!! ...please wish me luck
2023-07-09 I really depend on the MILD successes to get me through the, uh, YOU know OTHER stuff
2023-07-10 nuthin' wrong with a little thing holding you together... it's nice that little things can do that sometimes, right?
2023-07-11 fellow Small Creature, such a placid, comforting presence!  though I suppose your brain could be on fire just like mine right now
2023-07-12 boy, sometimes you really gotta put a lot of effort into finding out whether you made a BAD DECISION
2023-07-13 whatever happens today, I don't mind... I don't BRAIN either all the THINKY stuff, you know? not happening today
2023-07-14 I KNOW I can enjoy things about where I'm AT but GOSH aren't there just some complicating factors at every turn
2023-07-15 YESTERDAY did not really WORK OUT but I still made it to TODAY
2023-07-16 I don't hafta be able to USE the space I create for  somebody else I can still feel good about making it
2023-07-17 sometimes it ain't a lot to give someone a bit of comfort! but it's always worth it!!
2023-07-18 somedays I got NUTHIN' except just like... BEIN' here  somedays that's all I need
2023-07-19 here we go to fight the futility
2023-07-20 I am gonna CHOOSE my form of exhaustion today!
2023-07-21 some  friends are... PRICKLY FRIENDS!  we can deal with some prickles together, right??
2023-07-22 just out here doin' a friendly ASSIST for a fellow earthling
2023-07-23 sometimes you get a headstart on personal growth and you can't quite  see it without an outside perspective y'gotta check yourself out every now and again!
2023-07-24 got a lot of skills that are not strictly "necessary", but BOY do they come in handy when life is tryin' to SMUSH ya
2023-07-25 I don't always AGREE with my brain's METHODS, but I can respect it's trying its best to keep me  "SAFE"... whatever THAT might mean
2023-07-26 gotta stop worrying about the MERITS of the thing I'm makin'... if I MAKE a thing, it's got merit 'cause I MADE IT!!!
2023-07-27 tryin' hard not to let the impermanent and fleeting nature of joy and beauty get me down but to instead make me appreciate the moments even more
2023-07-28 getting  somewhere always takes time, even if it's just a Brain Place
2023-07-29 some days I gotta be proud of the nuthin' I'm doing
2023-07-30 not sure how long it will last, but getting some LIFT really changes your perspective on things
2023-07-31 I have a SNEAKING SUSPICION that you could use some nice thoughts in your brain today...? regardless, I am prepared to upload SEVERAL affirmations of your GOODNESS directly to your person
2023-08-01 I like to think that I am mostly just minding my own business... but my business tends to include being excited for all of my friends
2023-08-02 I KNOW I ain't gonna let one 'oops' determine how my WHOLE DAY goes... but  still  you know
2023-08-03 I offer no apologgies: I goof to survive
2023-08-04 guess who's emotionally regulated and REARIN' to go??
2023-08-05 I can offer coherence or ENTHUSIASM but PLEASE do not expect both
2023-08-06 really wish my imagination would wait for APPROVAL before deciding to work OVERTIME hours
2023-08-07 imperfectly, we continue
2023-08-08 I wish my To-Do List Persona would stick around long enough to deal with the expectations it leaves for me
2023-08-09 are you doing anything? NOPE aw yeah, today is gonna be AWESOME
2023-08-10 am I doin' GOOD yet?? it does not need to be accurate, but I would like to know if anyone is paying attention
2023-08-11 even when I make 'em the exact same way, each cup of tea is just a little bit different so how can I be certain of anything
2023-08-12 I am still 'past me' as well as 'future me' and I think they can both be proud of each other
2023-08-13 please  allow me to introduce: My Friend apparently I have intrinsic value!!
2023-08-14 I am putting on a "brave face" today and I expect RESULTS
2023-08-15 I am READY! I have THOUGHTS today!!
2023-08-16 sometimes I gotta wear a fun hat to remind myself that we are all magnificently complex and wonderful beings
2023-08-17 oh, me? I am doing QUITE WELL thank you can't you tell
2023-08-18 I am not AFRAID but I would still like a HUG
2023-08-19 I THINK I  am having a good time, but I find it difficult to be certain without peer review
2023-08-20 we've got this, by gum
2023-08-21 sometimes the SHAPE of joy is... an unfamiliar thing but if you get it in your hands you can feel it out, I think
2023-08-22 I am ok with being strong but I do not wish it to be a requirement
2023-08-23 I wanna do stuff WELL but I will also settle for just... doing stuff
2023-08-24 ...or to just be accepted regardless today I wish for socially acceptable ways of expressing my interest in THINGS...
2023-08-25 nothing much has changed today and I still do not understand much but I  go to it bravely
2023-08-26 just kinda bewildered that today managed to happen so I'm just gonna take a moment
2023-08-27 doing MANAGEABLY today
2023-08-28 interactions are a premium service today, I think
2023-08-29 I think you are doing wonderfully oh, thanks!
2023-08-30 I ain't a BURDEN I'm a BONUS 
2023-08-31 aw geez feelin' AWARE of stuff today
2023-09-01 Z
2023-09-02 basic functionality has been achieved!!
2023-09-03 just waiting until I don't feel terrible before I start gettin' things done might take a while but I am committed
2023-09-04 wonder if my own maintenance is too difficult or if I just got the wrong tools
2023-09-05 SOMEONE ought to know that I am doing my best somehow it's not me
2023-09-06 I think most things worth doing are like breakfast if it feels too early or too late, it's probably still the right time to do it
2023-09-07 I may feel like an inanimate  object today but by golly I'm  gonna be a SUCCESSFUL object
2023-09-08 oh hey, it's 'Tomorrow' I think that means we get another try at stuff
2023-09-09 my goodness, I am heavily craving distraction from the incessant Brain Noise
2023-09-10 I appreciate that you make me feel exceptional I appreciate that you make me feel normal
2023-09-11 I will accept today's discomforts with the promise of an equal amount of aftercare
2023-09-12 things aren't going as PLANNED, but they ARE going so we're halfway there
2023-09-13 I'm doing my darndest to CHERISH it all, but it's a LOT, ok??
2023-09-14 'nother day of fakin' it ahead of me
2023-09-15 ready for the PUSH not so sure  I'm ready for the ROLL
2023-09-16 lookin' for a NICE TIME today, but I am prepared for ALTERNATIVES
2023-09-17 I'm trying to be better and it doesn't happen every day but it's still happening
2023-09-18 just waitin' for the random chance of becoming motivated to trigger
2023-09-19 there is only one thing on my to-do list today, but I am going to accomplish it  INTENTIONALLY
2023-09-20 I am dealing with a SURPLUS of confusion today so I hope you do not mind me sharing it GENEROUSLY
2023-09-21 treating myself to a small dose of obliviousness to get by today
2023-09-22 it seems some critical functions failed to load today so we're just gonna operate in safe mode for now
2023-09-23 got a busy day of feigning confidence ahead of me!!!
2023-09-24 despite the Horrors I think we look pretty good
2023-09-25 some days I can only manage the lower tiers of self-care but I'll take what I can get
2023-09-26 I am a being of MANY mysteries, such as when I will have the will to get out of bed
2023-09-27 doing a thing 'cause it's what I CAN do working my way towards what I NEED to do
2023-09-28 oh, don't mind me, just having a good YEARN for a bit
2023-09-29 I worked HARD to get here and while the lack of celebratory cakes is disappointing, I am DEALING  with it
2023-09-30 good I heard you were really productive at the beginning of the week how are you now?
2023-10-01 I am glad that we are managing to get through existence together in our own ways
2023-10-02 please enjoy your weirdness at least a LITTLE bit
2023-10-03 I have arrived, despite a total lack of preparation!
2023-10-04 gosh   I'm suddenly feeling quite motivated to be productive
2023-10-05 I don't get why 'GUILT' gets to be a little BONUS emotion attached to all the other emotions ...I mean, 'SILLY' is right there ready to go
2023-10-06 I DEMAND cuddles... when it's like, convenient for you ..or NOW ...if it's cool
2023-10-07 could it be that the TERRORS have subsided? or is this just a nice cup of tea
2023-10-08 doin' my scheduled interval of subjecting myself to  nature's majesty 
2023-10-09 I'm good with today being mercifully boring, how about you?
2023-10-10 nice to have a friend who can lift you up... and catch you when it feels a little too high
2023-10-11 the day is long and full of interactables! I am aware
2023-10-12 I think I'd like a LOW-KEY day today...! then I will take my HYPE to a SAFE OPERATING DISTANCE
2023-10-13 thank you for subjecting yourself to me... and here is to many more days of YOU being subjected to ME!!
2023-10-14 ...is it gone yet? no, today is still here for a while
2023-10-15 only screamed ONCE so far good job
2023-10-16 I hope you do not feel pressure to 'entertain' me just knowing you are comfortable in my presence is sufficiently enriching Z
2023-10-17 do you... need a SPRITZ? yeah spritz me up
2023-10-18 I hope this action will convey meaning for which I do not have words balloon!! which is perhaps a start
2023-10-19 set my alarm clock to an aspirational time again  it's gonna be ok
2023-10-20 great day to stand in a hole!!
2023-10-21 I am proud of my friend for the cool things they do! and I'Mm tAKin' their wORd for it!!
2023-10-22 today I am demonstrating the flexibility of the meaning of "functional"
2023-10-23 it's a fine day
2023-10-24 here is my Serious Business Suitcase it has sufficient storage for the amount of Serious Business that I can handle today
2023-10-25 AawWw GOSH - I'm tryin' PRETTY HARD, I think
2023-10-26 don't mind me just bein' AWARE of stuff today
2023-10-27 SAME I seem to have lots of creative ways to make myself feel SMALL
2023-10-28 oh shucks I was SURE I'd plugged that thing in
2023-10-29 betcha can't tell when I'm just PRETENDING to razzle my dazzle
2023-10-30 come on, we're switching up self-care methods for now but... my carbohydrates..
2023-10-31 sometimes the SCOPE of a new friendship is... surprising but not unwelcome
2023-11-01 wish I knew how to give myself permission to start
2023-11-02 it may be suboptimal, but I gotta be ME!
2023-11-03 anything good out there? distinctly possible!
2023-11-04 figured that cataloguing everything  I'm NOT worried about would be a pretty quick job but I forgot how creative I am at worrying
2023-11-05 ...remind me why we are doing this distraction from the horrors! you are doing very well!
2023-11-06 I am doing OK although it would always be nice to be better
2023-11-07 hmm, did my FIXATION shift, or am I an entirely NEW PERSON today???
2023-11-08 today has to happen... to ME?? but I am just a small small thing!!
2023-11-09 I am  content to be appreciated by the ones who matter most to ME 
2023-11-10 you're gonna do SO GOOD today!! yyyeaaaaaaaah!!!
2023-11-11 I am the GUARDIAN of QUIET TIME ...a sacred duty
2023-11-12 gentleness must be adaptable
2023-11-13 hopin' for a REGULAR ONE today
2023-11-14 gotta give myself credit for the dubiously impressive feats it takes to get me into these situations
2023-11-15 I wish I wasn't just keeping my head above water I think you're doing great
2023-11-16 seems reasonable hmmmm I think today I should be miraculously better at everything I've been struggling with 
2023-11-17 I know I'm a BIG DEAL to SOMEbody!! hopefully I find out who they are
2023-11-18 I did my best YESTERDAY today is all about COASTING
2023-11-19 it's maybe surprising that we're both here... but rather delightful, isn't it?
2023-11-20 ok I'm here ...I forget what happens next
2023-11-21 can't WAIT until my intention and focus SYNC UP so that I can comprehend this sentence I'm trying to read
2023-11-22 somedays I'm just spendin' the day confused!! no big deal!!
2023-11-23 just gotta get through this one, y'know?
2023-11-24 the universe conspires to convince me that any good I attempt to do is futile but it can't stop me from making someone a cup of tea, so what does IT know
2023-11-25 you are a fascinating spectacle and I just wanna keep collecting data
2023-11-26 the universe conspires to convince me that any good I attempt to do is futile but it can't stop me from making someone a cup of tea, so what does IT know
2023-11-27 thank you for listening thanks for being a soothing aural backdrop
2023-11-28 I'm AWARE of the BIG PICTURE, it's just calibrating the resolution that's the tricky part
2023-11-29 managing PRETTY GOOD today!!  very proud of you
2023-11-30 oh today's got a BIG OOF kinda vibe well, let's OOF it together then
2023-12-01 had this NEAT IDEA that I don't hafta BUY comfort with a certain amount of suffering I'm  allowed to just FIND IT
2023-12-02 go hug a WEIRDO today I'm choosing MYSELF
2023-12-03 I'm idling but I still need energy ...ain't gonna feel guilty 'bout THAT
2023-12-04 so sorry... I require... maintenance today... YES! because you are a thing of QUALITY!
2023-12-05 I can lend you the 'Ten Gallon Clucker' aw dang it's the FEELS again... ...don't even got a silly hat to get me through it
2023-12-06 I am... a PRETTY THING!! that's RIGHT, I just get to DECIDE that!!
2023-12-07 my enrichment needs are simple but things will get COMPLICATED if they are interrupted
2023-12-08 just letting you all know that I am VERY FRIENDLY!!!
2023-12-09 good morning! I hope the stresses of yesterday have dissipated in the face of today's determination!
2023-12-10 sure, I'm lost! ain't a  big deal an' I'm not the only one!
2023-12-11 giving myself permission to stay in the Comfort Zone today as a little TREAT
2023-12-12 I declare myself ACCEPTABLE today
2023-12-13 still there? yeah
2023-12-14 bein' 'BUSY' might just mean I'm takin' CARE of myself, OK??
2023-12-15 feelin' real proud of you
2023-12-16 couldn't have gotten this far... ...without giving myself some LITTLE TREATS
2023-12-17 not sure HOW it's gonna happen but somehow I think I might be delighting someone today
2023-12-18 I am braced for shenanigans
2023-12-19 who's ready to WORRY about stuff?? ooh, me
2023-12-20 I suppose it is FASCINATING how many different flavours of TIRED there are every day is like a new free sample
2023-12-21 I think I can see myself getting through today
2023-12-22 don't worry, we're meant to  optimize TOGETHER dunno if I got the SPECS to handle today...
2023-12-23 givin' myself EXTRA CREDIT for the mundane stuff I get done while on a low battery 
2023-12-24 sometimes you got space for the THING, but not for the decision of where it GOES
2023-12-25 gotta remind THIS joker that there's some stuff they've done that's pretty OK
2023-12-26 it is ok to have nonsymmetrical rest cycles Z
2023-12-27 I am not DEFINED by my coping mechanisms but I am pretty proud of the healthy ones
2023-12-28 HEY! you said you were RESTING, so I hope this is not work that is motivated by GUILT?? NO, I... I think it is a TREAT...??
2023-12-29 you don't even know what 'fomo' IS, do you?
2023-12-30 just gonna get a headstart on the day and get into bed NOW
