2023-01-19 we are always starting something... ...sometimes it is a good thing... ...and sometimes it is something else
2023-01-20 I am mostly just trying to figure out what is going on
2023-01-21 I hope I can always be an ongoing process
2023-01-22 there are tasks to do!! I will attempt them!!!
2023-01-23 sometimes I just forget the things that make me happy... I guess it's a nice little surprise when I  remember, though
2023-01-24 communication is difficult!!! tea is much easier
2023-01-25 even if it is for a thing that is just for you it is okay to get some help
2023-01-26 thank you... it is the result of, um, several iterations! you have a wonderful design!
2023-01-27 today I am in development some functions may not execute as intended
2023-01-28 how come some days just feel like a Big Deal for no reason? might be the Anxiety
2023-01-29 I miss how I used to function ...but maybe I am just handling more complex processes now
2023-01-30 listen!! I am trying really hard! but it will not be obvious, probably!!!
2023-01-31 it is nice to meet someone else who is also just a little guy
2023-02-01 oh, I see so we're doing this whole THING again, huh!
2023-02-02 I guess I start over a lot that's okay
2023-02-03 gotta get these dang ideas out of my head before I start realizing that they are imperfect
2023-02-04 yeah, I have some difficult stuff to get through today I am just marinating about it first
2023-02-05 hoo boy I can tell we're gonna be WORKIN' today
2023-02-06 I am allowing myself a bit of denial that today is happening as a little TREAT
2023-02-07 oh, do not mind me I am just feeling a little  CURSED by SENTIENCE today
2023-02-08 I think I am probably doing this wrong but it is still a big improvement from NOT doing it
2023-02-09 I want to be DONE having THINGS to do but that usually means I gotta DO stuff first
2023-02-10 I would just like someone to appreciate what it took to get me here today it was a lot
2023-02-11 o-oh ok ok ok heeeeere we go, here we go
2023-02-12 today our special guest is Garbage Bot who has come to share their feelings on the state of things aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2023-02-13 some days I just gotta SCOOT 'cause sometimes that's easier than THINKIN'
2023-02-14 everyone  better  WATCH OUT I'm comin' atcha with REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS
2023-02-15 gosh we perceivin' things AGAIN today?
2023-02-16 the world is lucky to have you today and they might not even know think I'll go out and remind 'em
2023-02-17 do not forget to give yourself credit for being cute today despite everything
2023-02-18 some days that's just a real long way to go
2023-02-19 maybe more...?! I think I am doing pretty good by at least one metric...
2023-02-20 sometimes it is hard to know if you are balancing on just one bad thing happening until the thing happens
2023-02-21  I do not require a 'function' to function!! I'm just here doin' my thing!!
2023-02-22 today I am rated 'A' for Anxious and Adorable ...and, uh, Alreadytime-fora-nap
2023-02-23 I am ready to do some NONSENSE today
2023-02-24 time to do a little SHIMMY to help fend off the BAD TIMES 
2023-02-25 you have a ME! oh! today we have a You! that is very  good!
2023-02-26 listen UP! I'm just... HERE and I have NO IDEA what is going on! so, same drill as  yesterday, ok??
2023-02-27 'Today' is back! this time, featuring CIRCUMSTANCES
2023-02-28 please excuse me I just need a little help appreciating myself today nonverbal high-five interactions are acceptable
2023-03-01 it is never too late who even knows what time it is I mean
2023-03-02 Hey, you made it here, too!
2023-03-03 I really hope that there is someone out there who finds my constant confusion endearing
2023-03-04 oh  glorious day, please grant us an ok time
2023-03-05 I have no idea what I am doing!! oh, thank GOODNESS
2023-03-06 I am just a LITTLE thing but I am BIG PROUD!!
2023-03-07 I have put something on my head to make today feel a little special I am hoping it will effectively combat the Emptiness Inside
2023-03-08 none can deny the inscrutable, intrinsic value of a true companion
2023-03-09 we could perhaps reach a compromise of decibels IS IT SO WRONG TO BE "OVERLY DECLARATIVE" WHEN EXPRESSING HOW COOL I THINK MY FRIENDS ARE??
2023-03-10 sometimes I wonder if others see me as a waste of time... ...but like, a REALLY GOOD waste of time
2023-03-11 shucks today I'm just full-on BOOPED
2023-03-12 you  know, I did pretty good YESTERDAY so I'm just gonna ride that feeling for TODAY, thank you very MUCH
2023-03-13 so much STUFF to DO today  and even more stuff to WORRY about 
2023-03-14 do not go anywhere without your Implement Of Significance  today, mine is a spoon
2023-03-15 preparing for potential 'uh-oh's today got a bunch of 'Well Ok Then' and preemptive 'NOPE's at the ready
2023-03-16 got a  SPECIAL  PROJECT for today that involves chores, hot chocolate, and minimal crying the SEQUENCE of these activities will be a SURPRISE for EVERYONE 
2023-03-17 I may have a bit of MISPLACED confidence today but  I promise it just comes from some ACTUAL GROWTH in an unrelated area
2023-03-18 every time I do routine maintenance I find myself having to make revisions to this dang thing
2023-03-19 ooh, I have discovered a new thing I enjoy! ...my goodness do I hope it meets the approval of my peers
2023-03-20 WAIT a second, today's already started, and I'm... getting THROUGH it?? ...someone better be giving me a PRESENT when we're done
2023-03-21 I am proud and grateful to know that I  am but one of MANY Little Weirdos out there in the world
2023-03-22 who's ready to prioritize the ever-present desire for more sleep as a means to rationalize the avoidance of stressful commitments?? ooh, ooh!
2023-03-23 I have allocated sufficient capacity for approximately three 'OOF's today I MAY not accept responsibility for my actions if this is exceeded
2023-03-24 hmm, I may have miscalculated my interest in being productive today
2023-03-25 I would appreciate a REPRIEVE from most THINGS ...and STUFF too
2023-03-26 I believe my ambitions are REASONABLE all I want is to FINISH whatever I need to finish so that everyone leaves me ALONE
2023-03-27 I want to have one of those "WHO DID THIS  oh, it was me" moments except for it to be about a GOOD thing
2023-03-28 I am here just to BE, not to DO anything and it is still a GOOD way to use my TIME
2023-03-29 I expect GREAT  THINGS from this NAP... ...GREAT THINGS
2023-03-30 I'm SORRY but whatever stimulus you have for me is going to have to WAIT until I am done processing LAST week's stimulus ...it is milk... PROCESSING
2023-03-31 we did a good job getting here, didn't we?
2023-04-01 VERY excited for my weekend plans of lowvolume solitude
2023-04-02 not sure if it is an EFFORT day today trying to DECIDE is already a lot of WORK
2023-04-03 simply FULFILLING an obligation is not super motivating, I think knowing that I can SLACK OFF once the obligation is fulfilled, however...
2023-04-04 I am FILLED with an incomprehensible POWER!... like, please help I do NOT  know what to do with this energy
2023-04-05 I have worked very HARD to be sufficiently STABLE today
2023-04-06 sometimes making plans is a MISTAKE, but that's ok: I can still enjoy a cancelled plan  ...sometimes even more than the plan itself
2023-04-07 today is either going very WELL or very POORLY either, way somehow I've already made it PART-WAY through, so I'll take that as a WIN
2023-04-08 you can give a 'big' reward for a  'small' accomplishment it is  surprisingly NOT a big deal at all, I promise!!
2023-04-09 the PROBLEM is that I am always too busy to NOTICE when I am working HARD and then I am too TIRED to remember how hard I worked
2023-04-10 ok world, I am trying extra hard today!! and I would really like for it to make a bit of a difference, please!
2023-04-11 come, friend: let us COPE  our way healthily through this day TOGETHER
2023-04-12 time for a break! ... and probably some guilt! ... oh, woops
2023-04-13 today was tomorrow just yesterday and now I gotta deal with it??
2023-04-14 it is reassuring to see other things that keep going maybe we are all reassuring each other like that
2023-04-15 maybe I can surprise myself today by doing a Normal Thing
2023-04-16 trying really hard to have a SINGLE thought but I always seem to get UNWANTED COMBO deals
2023-04-17 I figured if I was tired of OUTPUTTING stuff I should rest with some INPUT but it turns out PUTTING stuff somewhere either way STILL makes me TIRED
2023-04-18 gosh it sure is tiring to be constantly resisting the urge to spice things up today
2023-04-19 once again I am compelled to offer TEA in the absence of COHERENT THOUGHTS ...I can just tell you about MY day, then
2023-04-20 oh, that LAST little chunk showing up  on my battery indicator? that is RESERVED  for some VERY IMPORTANT 'Being Useless' time at the  end of the day
2023-04-21 who  scheduled TODAY for right NOW  when I CLEARLY still need an extension on YESTERDAY
2023-04-22 feeling very compressed today it is probably just the Crushing Responsibilities again
2023-04-23 hey there ...oh,  me? just  VIBIN' and SURVIVIN', as usual
2023-04-24 I am PREPARED for today, but GOSH I am not READY
2023-04-25 gosh the STIMULI are hittin' real HARD today
2023-04-26 rootin' for today to NOT be a GARBAGE
2023-04-27 sometimes for everyone's SAFETY it is important to demarcate the boundaries of your VIBE 
2023-04-28 ...ah,  yes, the Terrors  what is this familiar feeling I am starting the day with...?
2023-04-29 let's DO this
2023-04-30 if I ever had a full battery, by golly I'd be formidable
2023-05-01 I'm ok, just waiting for Today to make the  first move
2023-05-02 this is all I GOT it's just me, but it's still SOMETHIN'
2023-05-03 commitments are sacred, so I do not enter into them LIGHTLY but I DO promise you, I WILL come back when you have boiled 
2023-05-04 this was entirely expected and yet: no umbrella! huh!
2023-05-05 I just think I deserve a little TREAT! ya  know! for  GETTIN' BY!!
2023-05-06 it might be impressive, but trust me when I say that I have NO idea how I got here
2023-05-07 being lazy can take a lot of work, but it's usually worth the effort
2023-05-08 ah, glorious Sunrise, harbinger of forgotten deadlines and  dreadful consciousness be gentle with me as I have no clue what is going on
2023-05-09 I have painstakingly prepared a PLAN for today I'm not very GOOD at planning so it's not a VERY GOOD PLAN, but it's SOMETHIN'
2023-05-10 WHO knows WHAT today brings??? SERIOUSLY I would like to KNOW 'cause I'm just kinda HANGIN' ON over here
2023-05-11 I'm gonna SUSTAIN myself out of SPITE and we'll see where things go from there
2023-05-12 may I also partake of  this patch of dirt yeah just give me five more minutes
2023-05-13 doin' GREAT
2023-05-14 what's on the AGENDA for today... ah, yes: PROBLEMS
2023-05-15 we are gonna do SO GOOD today and maybe only cry a LITTLE bit
2023-05-16 Here I am!! puttin' the 'FUN' in FUNCTIONAL
2023-05-17 I am GOOD just not always DOING good
2023-05-18 oh gosh I didn't prepare for things going WELL today
2023-05-19 GOSH sometimes thinkin' about the future really BUMS ME OUT so I just gotta be PRESENT for a bit
2023-05-20 pretty sure I saw some worthwhile stimuli somewhere over the horizon
2023-05-21 OH HEY you know you don't gotta do anything special for me to think that you are pretty great
2023-05-22 looks like it's gonna be another day of "Rolling With It" and you know, I think I am a good shape for that sort of thing
2023-05-23 it is another day of YOU! I suppose I can be convinced that this is a good thing
2023-05-24 just KEEPIN' ON is somehow both the EASIER and HARDERthing to do when I feel like GIVIN' UP  so here I am!!!
2023-05-25 SO, who's ready for more ME today?? 'CAUSE I'M NOT
2023-05-26 y'know what, falling flat on my FACE speaks to a level of CONFIDENCE which I MIGHT choose to be PROUD of
2023-05-27 well shucks, I've gone and BEWILDERED myself and the day's just BEGUN
2023-05-28 TOMORROW is full of TIME to get things DONE but it has a nasty habit of turning into TODAY
2023-05-29 I've only got my lowlevel coping skills available today but I'm gonna look GOOD while I'm usin' them
2023-05-30 I think I am just OK but gosh it was a hard-won battle to convince myself of it
2023-05-31 perhaps today we will encounter an item of GREAT POWER
2023-06-01 no one must know that I am not feeling completely fabulous today
2023-06-02 trying to get the most difficult thing done FIRST so that I can enjoy the rest of the day but then the whole day ends up BEING the most difficult part??
2023-06-03 I promise to start functioning normally once I find a place to plug this stupid thing in
2023-06-04 I just think that everyone did a good job getting here
2023-06-05 it maybe was not the BIGGEST stumbling block but I got over it!!!
2023-06-06 things are 'Normal' today ...which is to say that they could be much IMPROVED
2023-06-07 I can't quite manage BRUTE force solutions but I can do CUTE FORCE
2023-06-08 oh gosh, I'm HERE I don't always plan for this
2023-06-09 I find  COMFORT in not knowing what the HECK I am doing because I  am assuredly NOT ALONE
2023-06-10 oh WOW life is just a LOT, isn't it
2023-06-11 I am PROUD of my functionality today it occassionally gets me places!!
2023-06-12 I know Reality is just kinda doing its own thing I just wanna be a PART of it
2023-06-13 I'm so good at distracting myself sometimes I don't realize how tiring an activity it is
2023-06-14 OOPS I am unavoidably MYSELF
2023-06-15 NEXT UP on my list of things I do NOT wish to engage with: it's.... TODAY!
2023-06-16 I think we will ALWAYS be, like, getting through... "it" ... I think that's kinda nice
2023-06-17 I feel like I got pretty BASIC expectations of stuff, but it also still feels like a LOT??
2023-06-18 today does not need to be GOOD but I hope it is kind
2023-06-19 I am READY for NONSENSE but I would PREFER... something else
2023-06-20 do not despair! none of us are any good at this stuff and somehow things keep on going
2023-06-21 NEVER STOP LOVING YOURSELF
2023-06-22 sometimes I only got one NICE THING to give away in a day ...sometimes I gotta save it for ME
2023-06-23 sometimes you are a resting place for someone, and you don't even know it
2023-06-24 I know it changes VERY LITTLE but I need everyone to know that I am VERY SLEEPY today!!!
2023-06-25 trying out a NEW thing where I TRUST myself not to combust into a conflagration of incendiary anxiety
2023-06-26 I am probably due to think better of myself today
2023-06-27 how I admire the simplistic complexities of being of NATURE ... what mystifying ELEGANCE and GRACE
2023-06-28 today seems like a GOOD DAY to create a buffer of accomplishments to sustain me through the crushing wave of ENNUI in the evening forecast
2023-06-29 I'm gettin' through today but gosh I'm looking forward to clearing my memory cache at the end of it
2023-06-30 sometimes when someone remembers me I think "do I deserve it" but I also think: "please don't forget"
2023-07-01 today I suggest offering compassion to a small creature ...the small creature  could be me
2023-07-02 I got THINGS to do, but snuggles take priority
2023-07-03 I may not have PLANNED to be ME, but I will certainly not apologize for it ... (sorry)
2023-07-04 oh I would like to recalibrate today's volume, please, so that everything is not shouting at me
2023-07-05 sometimes I worry whether I'm working HARD ENOUGH until I remember how exhausting it is to be ME
2023-07-06 MY TURN to be NOISY today!!!
2023-07-07 hey you got my permission to go bananas in  your preferred method while I maintain a safe distance ok but I don't even think I got bananas in me today
2023-07-08 today I'm gonna trust that my usefulness does NOT determine my WORTH!! ...please wish me luck
2023-07-09 I really depend on the MILD successes to get me through the, uh, YOU know OTHER stuff
2023-07-10 nuthin' wrong with a little thing holding you together... it's nice that little things can do that sometimes, right?
2023-07-11 fellow Small Creature, such a placid, comforting presence!  though I suppose your brain could be on fire just like mine right now
2023-07-12 boy, sometimes you really gotta put a lot of effort into finding out whether you made a BAD DECISION
2023-07-13 whatever happens today, I don't mind... I don't BRAIN either all the THINKY stuff, you know? not happening today
2023-07-14 I KNOW I can enjoy things about where I'm AT but GOSH aren't there just some complicating factors at every turn
2023-07-15 YESTERDAY did not really WORK OUT but I still made it to TODAY
2023-07-16 I don't hafta be able to USE the space I create for  somebody else I can still feel good about making it
2023-07-17 sometimes it ain't a lot to give someone a bit of comfort! but it's always worth it!!
2023-07-18 somedays I got NUTHIN' except just like... BEIN' here  somedays that's all I need
2023-07-19 here we go to fight the futility
2023-07-20 I am gonna CHOOSE my form of exhaustion today!
2023-07-21 some  friends are... PRICKLY FRIENDS!  we can deal with some prickles together, right??
2023-07-22 just out here doin' a friendly ASSIST for a fellow earthling
2023-07-23 sometimes you get a headstart on personal growth and you can't quite  see it without an outside perspective y'gotta check yourself out every now and again!
2023-07-24 got a lot of skills that are not strictly "necessary", but BOY do they come in handy when life is tryin' to SMUSH ya
2023-07-25 I don't always AGREE with my brain's METHODS, but I can respect it's trying its best to keep me  "SAFE"... whatever THAT might mean
2023-07-26 gotta stop worrying about the MERITS of the thing I'm makin'... if I MAKE a thing, it's got merit 'cause I MADE IT!!!
2023-07-27 tryin' hard not to let the impermanent and fleeting nature of joy and beauty get me down but to instead make me appreciate the moments even more
2023-07-28 getting  somewhere always takes time, even if it's just a Brain Place
2023-07-29 some days I gotta be proud of the nuthin' I'm doing
2023-07-30 not sure how long it will last, but getting some LIFT really changes your perspective on things
2023-07-31 I have a SNEAKING SUSPICION that you could use some nice thoughts in your brain today...? regardless, I am prepared to upload SEVERAL affirmations of your GOODNESS directly to your person
2023-08-01 I like to think that I am mostly just minding my own business... but my business tends to include being excited for all of my friends
2023-08-02 I KNOW I ain't gonna let one 'oops' determine how my WHOLE DAY goes... but  still  you know
2023-08-03 I offer no apologgies: I goof to survive
2023-08-04 guess who's emotionally regulated and REARIN' to go??
2023-08-05 I can offer coherence or ENTHUSIASM but PLEASE do not expect both
2023-08-06 really wish my imagination would wait for APPROVAL before deciding to work OVERTIME hours
2023-08-07 imperfectly, we continue
2023-08-08 I wish my To-Do List Persona would stick around long enough to deal with the expectations it leaves for me
2023-08-09 are you doing anything? NOPE aw yeah, today is gonna be AWESOME
2023-08-10 am I doin' GOOD yet?? it does not need to be accurate, but I would like to know if anyone is paying attention
2023-08-11 even when I make 'em the exact same way, each cup of tea is just a little bit different so how can I be certain of anything
2023-08-12 I am still 'past me' as well as 'future me' and I think they can both be proud of each other
2023-08-13 please  allow me to introduce: My Friend apparently I have intrinsic value!!
2023-08-14 I am putting on a "brave face" today and I expect RESULTS
2023-08-15 I am READY! I have THOUGHTS today!!
2023-08-16 sometimes I gotta wear a fun hat to remind myself that we are all magnificently complex and wonderful beings
2023-08-17 oh, me? I am doing QUITE WELL thank you can't you tell
2023-08-18 I am not AFRAID but I would still like a HUG
2023-08-19 I THINK I  am having a good time, but I find it difficult to be certain without peer review
2023-08-20 we've got this, by gum
2023-08-21 sometimes the SHAPE of joy is... an unfamiliar thing but if you get it in your hands you can feel it out, I think
2023-08-22 I am ok with being strong but I do not wish it to be a requirement
2023-08-23 I wanna do stuff WELL but I will also settle for just... doing stuff
2023-08-24 ...or to just be accepted regardless today I wish for socially acceptable ways of expressing my interest in THINGS...
2023-08-25 nothing much has changed today and I still do not understand much but I  go to it bravely
2023-08-26 just kinda bewildered that today managed to happen so I'm just gonna take a moment
2023-08-27 doing MANAGEABLY today
2023-08-28 interactions are a premium service today, I think
2023-08-29 I think you are doing wonderfully oh, thanks!
2023-08-30 I ain't a BURDEN I'm a BONUS 
2023-08-31 aw geez feelin' AWARE of stuff today
2023-09-01 Z
2023-09-02 basic functionality has been achieved!!
2023-09-03 just waiting until I don't feel terrible before I start gettin' things done might take a while but I am committed
2023-09-04 wonder if my own maintenance is too difficult or if I just got the wrong tools
2023-09-05 SOMEONE ought to know that I am doing my best somehow it's not me
2023-09-06 I think most things worth doing are like breakfast if it feels too early or too late, it's probably still the right time to do it
2023-09-07 I may feel like an inanimate  object today but by golly I'm  gonna be a SUCCESSFUL object
2023-09-08 oh hey, it's 'Tomorrow' I think that means we get another try at stuff
2023-09-09 my goodness, I am heavily craving distraction from the incessant Brain Noise
2023-09-10 I appreciate that you make me feel exceptional I appreciate that you make me feel normal
2023-09-11 I will accept today's discomforts with the promise of an equal amount of aftercare
2023-09-12 things aren't going as PLANNED, but they ARE going so we're halfway there
2023-09-13 I'm doing my darndest to CHERISH it all, but it's a LOT, ok??
2023-09-14 'nother day of fakin' it ahead of me
2023-09-15 ready for the PUSH not so sure  I'm ready for the ROLL
2023-09-16 lookin' for a NICE TIME today, but I am prepared for ALTERNATIVES
2023-09-17 I'm trying to be better and it doesn't happen every day but it's still happening
2023-09-18 just waitin' for the random chance of becoming motivated to trigger
2023-09-19 there is only one thing on my to-do list today, but I am going to accomplish it  INTENTIONALLY
2023-09-20 I am dealing with a SURPLUS of confusion today so I hope you do not mind me sharing it GENEROUSLY
2023-09-21 treating myself to a small dose of obliviousness to get by today
2023-09-22 it seems some critical functions failed to load today so we're just gonna operate in safe mode for now
2023-09-23 got a busy day of feigning confidence ahead of me!!!
2023-09-24 despite the Horrors I think we look pretty good
2023-09-25 some days I can only manage the lower tiers of self-care but I'll take what I can get
2023-09-26 I am a being of MANY mysteries, such as when I will have the will to get out of bed
2023-09-27 doing a thing 'cause it's what I CAN do working my way towards what I NEED to do
2023-09-28 oh, don't mind me, just having a good YEARN for a bit
2023-09-29 I worked HARD to get here and while the lack of celebratory cakes is disappointing, I am DEALING  with it
2023-09-30 good I heard you were really productive at the beginning of the week how are you now?
2023-10-01 I am glad that we are managing to get through existence together in our own ways
2023-10-02 please enjoy your weirdness at least a LITTLE bit
2023-10-03 I have arrived, despite a total lack of preparation!
2023-10-04 gosh   I'm suddenly feeling quite motivated to be productive
2023-10-05 I don't get why 'GUILT' gets to be a little BONUS emotion attached to all the other emotions ...I mean, 'SILLY' is right there ready to go
2023-10-06 I DEMAND cuddles... when it's like, convenient for you ..or NOW ...if it's cool
2023-10-07 could it be that the TERRORS have subsided? or is this just a nice cup of tea
2023-10-08 doin' my scheduled interval of subjecting myself to  nature's majesty 
2023-10-09 I'm good with today being mercifully boring, how about you?
2023-10-10 nice to have a friend who can lift you up... and catch you when it feels a little too high
2023-10-11 the day is long and full of interactables! I am aware
2023-10-12 I think I'd like a LOW-KEY day today...! then I will take my HYPE to a SAFE OPERATING DISTANCE
2023-10-13 thank you for subjecting yourself to me... and here is to many more days of YOU being subjected to ME!!
2023-10-14 ...is it gone yet? no, today is still here for a while
2023-10-15 only screamed ONCE so far good job
2023-10-16 I hope you do not feel pressure to 'entertain' me just knowing you are comfortable in my presence is sufficiently enriching Z
2023-10-17 do you... need a SPRITZ? yeah spritz me up
2023-10-18 I hope this action will convey meaning for which I do not have words balloon!! which is perhaps a start
2023-10-19 set my alarm clock to an aspirational time again  it's gonna be ok
2023-10-20 great day to stand in a hole!!
2023-10-21 I am proud of my friend for the cool things they do! and I'Mm tAKin' their wORd for it!!
2023-10-22 today I am demonstrating the flexibility of the meaning of "functional"
2023-10-23 it's a fine day
2023-10-24 here is my Serious Business Suitcase it has sufficient storage for the amount of Serious Business that I can handle today
2023-10-25 AawWw GOSH - I'm tryin' PRETTY HARD, I think
2023-10-26 don't mind me just bein' AWARE of stuff today
2023-10-27 SAME I seem to have lots of creative ways to make myself feel SMALL
2023-10-28 oh shucks I was SURE I'd plugged that thing in
2023-10-29 betcha can't tell when I'm just PRETENDING to razzle my dazzle
2023-10-30 come on, we're switching up self-care methods for now but... my carbohydrates..
2023-10-31 sometimes the SCOPE of a new friendship is... surprising but not unwelcome
2023-11-01 wish I knew how to give myself permission to start
2023-11-02 it may be suboptimal, but I gotta be ME!
2023-11-03 anything good out there? distinctly possible!
2023-11-04 figured that cataloguing everything  I'm NOT worried about would be a pretty quick job but I forgot how creative I am at worrying
2023-11-05 ...remind me why we are doing this distraction from the horrors! you are doing very well!
2023-11-06 I am doing OK although it would always be nice to be better
2023-11-07 hmm, did my FIXATION shift, or am I an entirely NEW PERSON today???
2023-11-08 today has to happen... to ME?? but I am just a small small thing!!
2023-11-09 I am  content to be appreciated by the ones who matter most to ME 
2023-11-10 you're gonna do SO GOOD today!! yyyeaaaaaaaah!!!
2023-11-11 I am the GUARDIAN of QUIET TIME ...a sacred duty
2023-11-12 gentleness must be adaptable
2023-11-13 hopin' for a REGULAR ONE today
2023-11-14 gotta give myself credit for the dubiously impressive feats it takes to get me into these situations
2023-11-15 I wish I wasn't just keeping my head above water I think you're doing great
2023-11-16 seems reasonable hmmmm I think today I should be miraculously better at everything I've been struggling with 
2023-11-17 I know I'm a BIG DEAL to SOMEbody!! hopefully I find out who they are
2023-11-18 I did my best YESTERDAY today is all about COASTING
2023-11-19 it's maybe surprising that we're both here... but rather delightful, isn't it?
2023-11-20 ok I'm here ...I forget what happens next
2023-11-21 can't WAIT until my intention and focus SYNC UP so that I can comprehend this sentence I'm trying to read
2023-11-22 somedays I'm just spendin' the day confused!! no big deal!!
2023-11-23 just gotta get through this one, y'know?
2023-11-24 the universe conspires to convince me that any good I attempt to do is futile but it can't stop me from making someone a cup of tea, so what does IT know
2023-11-25 you are a fascinating spectacle and I just wanna keep collecting data
2023-11-26 the universe conspires to convince me that any good I attempt to do is futile but it can't stop me from making someone a cup of tea, so what does IT know
2023-11-27 thank you for listening thanks for being a soothing aural backdrop
2023-11-28 I'm AWARE of the BIG PICTURE, it's just calibrating the resolution that's the tricky part
2023-11-29 managing PRETTY GOOD today!!  very proud of you
2023-11-30 oh today's got a BIG OOF kinda vibe well, let's OOF it together then
2023-12-01 had this NEAT IDEA that I don't hafta BUY comfort with a certain amount of suffering I'm  allowed to just FIND IT
2023-12-02 go hug a WEIRDO today I'm choosing MYSELF
2023-12-03 I'm idling but I still need energy ...ain't gonna feel guilty 'bout THAT
2023-12-04 so sorry... I require... maintenance today... YES! because you are a thing of QUALITY!
2023-12-05 I can lend you the 'Ten Gallon Clucker' aw dang it's the FEELS again... ...don't even got a silly hat to get me through it
2023-12-06 I am... a PRETTY THING!! that's RIGHT, I just get to DECIDE that!!
2023-12-07 my enrichment needs are simple but things will get COMPLICATED if they are interrupted
2023-12-08 just letting you all know that I am VERY FRIENDLY!!!
2023-12-09 good morning! I hope the stresses of yesterday have dissipated in the face of today's determination!
2023-12-10 sure, I'm lost! ain't a  big deal an' I'm not the only one!
2023-12-11 giving myself permission to stay in the Comfort Zone today as a little TREAT
2023-12-12 I declare myself ACCEPTABLE today
2023-12-13 still there? yeah
2023-12-14 bein' 'BUSY' might just mean I'm takin' CARE of myself, OK??
2023-12-15 feelin' real proud of you
2023-12-16 couldn't have gotten this far... ...without giving myself some LITTLE TREATS
2023-12-17 not sure HOW it's gonna happen but somehow I think I might be delighting someone today
2023-12-18 I am braced for shenanigans
2023-12-19 who's ready to WORRY about stuff?? ooh, me
2023-12-20 I suppose it is FASCINATING how many different flavours of TIRED there are every day is like a new free sample
2023-12-21 I think I can see myself getting through today
2023-12-22 don't worry, we're meant to  optimize TOGETHER dunno if I got the SPECS to handle today...
2023-12-23 givin' myself EXTRA CREDIT for the mundane stuff I get done while on a low battery 
2023-12-24 sometimes you got space for the THING, but not for the decision of where it GOES
2023-12-25 gotta remind THIS joker that there's some stuff they've done that's pretty OK
2023-12-26 it is ok to have nonsymmetrical rest cycles Z
2023-12-27 I am not DEFINED by my coping mechanisms but I am pretty proud of the healthy ones
2023-12-28 HEY! you said you were RESTING, so I hope this is not work that is motivated by GUILT?? NO, I... I think it is a TREAT...??
2023-12-29 you don't even know what 'fomo' IS, do you?
2023-12-30 just gonna get a headstart on the day and get into bed NOW

2021-10-01 oh, I finished!... ...writing it, that is now it is time for my scheduled "lie in a heap" break hey Copique, how is your to-do list coming along?
2021-10-18 is it wrong that my takeaway from that last one is to follow my urges to hide in a hole in the ground? live your truth, friend this concludes the new-resident orientation as you can see, we do our best to meet our daily quota of positive affirmations any  questions? yes, Parcel?
2021-10-19 that is... a creative extrapolation? but no, there is no such running total all the same I feel a strong desire for large quantities of positivity fair I assume my 'positive affirmation' count is inversely  offset by my 'negative assertion' count in which case I have a good deal of catch-up to do  I am looking forward to bringing my affirmation count into the positives I'm not... what do  you mean, Parcel?
2021-10-02  I get the feeling that not enough people know it is half-past hug o' clock for me
2021-10-20 what if... I DESIRE a punitive rubric? ( I must  remember to stop mentioning the punitive rubric )  do we get in trouble if we do not meet our daily affirmation quota? no, no... the intent of the quota is to provide a comforting framework, not a measurement for some... punitive rubric!
2021-10-21 how do we validate our daily affirmations for positivity? there is  no external oversight, so any level of positivity is  acceptable, provided it is genuine in its expression ...wait, so I actually have to MEAN it? it is recommended, yes but that...! is difficult!!
2021-10-22 what if... I cannot be genuinely positive in my affirmations? sometimes it just takes a number of...  af-FORCE-mations to get to a genuine one 
2021-10-23 I think I am giving what I got right now! I am okay with finding out I can do more... at a later time!
2021-10-24 I do  not think I want to BE  "normal" but once in a while I would like to feel that way
2021-10-25 it is just extra tiring to do that on top of all the other things, you know? oh hello, it is me, Chris I hope you are not being too hard on yourself today
2021-10-26 maybe today we can look at some plants they are always doing their best in a myriad of imperceptible ways  just like us
2021-10-27 sometimes  it is hard to figure out where you want to be although the concept of "not here" can provide some reliable motivation
2021-10-28 some days it is just easiest to lead by example
2021-10-29 ( it does not ) ... does it matter? is it selfactualization?... or is it just a very nice cup of tea?
2021-10-03 I think I know how to be nice to myself the challenge is convincing myself that I deserve it
2021-10-30 ...in summary: I recommend procuring a cup of tea at your earliest convenience for the sake of personal  growth  this guy gets it
2021-10-31 sure, there is sometimes loneliness that comes with solitude but not having to be perceived by anyone more than makes up for that
2021-10-04 ...do you need ME to do aerobics? no, I need you to hold the camera sounds perfect I want to produce a new motivational program to broadcast town-wide  this time the theme is... AEROBICS of course, Keke, I enjoy helping Chris, could I get your help with something?
2021-10-05 many people assume that the secret to motivational exercise is FASHION however if FASHION is not available, unbridled confidence alone  works just fine 
2021-10-06 for example: I will answer emails AND be actively social today! oh yeah that's a stretch *LIVE just as stretching one's appendages is an important component of exercise, a stretch of the IMAGINATION can be an effective means to begin the process of self-motivation! Keke's  Motivation  Station!
2021-10-07 *LIVE oftentimes getting started is much harder than the task itself! I suggest emitting low, guttural noises until you find yourself doing the Thing! Keke's  Motivation  Station!
2021-10-08 *LIVE *LIVE *LIVE our final technique is the Self-Sufficiency Circle of Power! start by visualizing your motivational energy: channeled through your appendages, it creates a cocoon around you as you invoke words of affirmation: I   AM SELF  SUFFICIENT! now LEAP from your cocoon, fully formed and completely independ- ...Chris, I may need  some assistance recovering from the  self-sufficience portion of our program I see Keke's  Motivation  Station!
2021-11-01 I am  doing my best, and I cannot decide whether or not I want it to be apparent to others
2021-11-10 excuse me, Elan... what are you doing? I thought I was  "empathizing"... ...are you feeling regret, or is that just me?
2021-11-11 ok, ok, NOW we must be feeling the same thing, right? pretty sure I am discovering a completely new form of exhaustion  ...I enjoy group activities
2021-11-12 it's nice to have friends who can help you out of uncomfortable social situations
2021-11-13 I received an unexpected burst of positivity and I plan to ride it for as long as possible before it implodes sorry, I am a bit too busy to chat at the moment!
2021-11-14 when times get tough, it's time to do the Frustration Wiggle it feels good and it might wiggle you towards the next step
2021-11-15 I think it is okay to not feel a thing that you perceive an obligation to feel I suppose but it is easier  to worry about that than to  confront not  knowing where  to go next
2021-11-16 I think it is okay to not feel a thing that you perceive an obligation to feel I suppose but it is easier  to worry about that than to  confront not  knowing where  to go next
2021-11-17 sometimes the only goal I can focus on is finding the next distraction
2021-11-18 ...this  explains a lot as you are trying to recalibrate your sense of purpose, I hope you will consider that you are not obligated to be useful or rather, our definition of "usefulness" is... quite flexible 
2021-11-19 I do not  want to be  "useless"...  but I think I can get behind the  whole unconditional acceptance thing that seems to be going on here
2021-11-02 not feeling entirely sold  on consciousness today
2021-11-20 I'm gonna meet some goshdarn reasonable expectations today!!
2021-11-21 I have achieved some sort of balance it may not be the ideal, but at this point I will take what I can get
2021-11-22 sometimes I feel like I am useless and bad, but I am starting to recognize that those thoughts are poor motivation for positive change! so I am  taking that  as a win for now!
2021-11-23 a preemptive juice box may be in order ah, the unmistakable sense of foreboding that  precedes a garbage kind of day
2021-11-24 meet Garbage-bot! they perceive every day as a garbage day for maximum relatability Hello  Copique! I heard that you were having a garbage day ...and I may  have assembled  a relatable companion for you to share the day's  travails with
2021-11-25 ... yeah buddy aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa well, it's nice to meet you, Garbage Bot I guess we're both having crummy days, aren't we?
2021-11-26 ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh well, yeah... but I know that feeling eventually goes away ughhhhh Saeris, is Garbage Bot programmed to ACTUALLY experience every day as a bad day? isn’t that what you said it feels like?
2021-11-27 I am READY to NAP
2021-11-28 you have made it all the way to where you are! you did a good job!
2021-11-29 ...maybe I'll know after lunch another day and I STILL don't know what my purpose should be how long does it take to figure out what your existence is for?
2021-11-03 just getting myself hyped up to cope with whatever happens today
2021-11-30 I think we could be looking at a 4-pot situation o-oh my Parcel! In fact, I am engaged in vital tea deliveries and could use an extra hand, if you are willing! oh hi, Sointu! Do you need help with anything?
2021-11-04 I confess, sometimes I just ACT positive to  work myself up to actually BEING positive... ... I don't think I can tell the difference anymore, and I'm not sure if it matters
2021-11-05 h-...ha! oh hi there! didn't hear you over how well my executive function is... functioning!
2021-11-06 I just... gotta get to the next thing today is just a thing that is  happening
2021-11-07 I just think everyone is doing a pretty good job getting through stuff because we are here
2021-11-08 some days I just have a lot of feelings to feel so I gotta spend some time on the feeling rock
2021-11-09 long week ahead? maybe if so, I have preemptively assumed the appropriate position
2021-12-01 Sointu, wait is...  isn't this enough tea for now? oh! you sounded just like the internal  monologue I  usually ignore... ...what were you saying?
2021-12-10 “some good moments may not change a bad day  but they are still good moments.” “Dearest Individuals, I regret that my struggle to communicate verbally has impeded our understanding of each other, and it is my hope that this written missive conveys my sincere appreciation of your efforts to oppose my inherited existential mandate to feel like garbage...” what do you have there, Parcel? Garbage Bot wrote you a note!
2021-12-11 well, it is another day isn't it I am okay with trying again
2021-12-12 I think I am not concerned with what I get done today even if it is nothing I would  just like to choose it
2021-12-13 I think I am more than just my problems... ...but I sure wish it was easier to see past them
2021-12-14 Hi Parcel! Are you having some thinking time? it is that, or  it is worrying time ...they might be the same thing
2021-12-15 I wanna tell you about the interesting uses I found for megaphones today ...but I sense that it is Quiet Time right now, so   ...I will save it for later thank you Elan
2021-12-16 ...by physically endangering my person, yes a lack of subtlety is  very on-brand for me yes, seeing as your 'house' is a pond, over which you had literally suspended me from a tree so what  you're saying ...is that I brought you out of your comfort zone! you mean when I brought you to my house to hang out? Elan, we first met because my emergency autonomous delivery  function activated in response to a perceived danger to my cargo after I was entrusted to your care 
2021-12-17 is being self-aware just a series of confrontations with things you're scared of? most of the scary things I've confronted ended up being fun things in disguise when I became autonomous I was scared of my responsibilities and when I was told that I could relinquish my responsibilities if I wanted... I was scared of the choice
2021-12-18 I need to learn to trust myself more... except in regards to how much sleep I think i need
2021-12-19 I tend to be very accommodating because I figure no one else can be q uite as much trouble as putting up with myself every day
2021-12-02 I am bad at waiting for things, but it's not so bad when the Thing is tea that is brought by a friend isn't that right, Garbage Bot? buh
2021-12-20 I think I want to share a realization, but am worried that it will prove itself untrue as soon as I say it ooh! that sounds like what happens whenever I answer people's queries into what I plan to accomplish in a day
2021-12-21 it felt so nice to be welcomed with no expectation and so readily accommodated... but it also makes me feel that, to others, all I am is a sum of personal struggles requiring resolution or mitigation personally, I refuse to be mitigated
2021-12-22 quick and important reminder: you are cute and good!
2021-12-23 I think I still need support and accommodations but maybe also an occasional... GENTLE push out of my comfort zone I will admit this sort of nuance terrifies me, but ok I will try
2021-12-24 So! You've conquered your fear of failure, then! goodness gracious, no my conviction has just grown to match my fear partly, yes... the other part I am still a little embarrassed to say... ...I want to complete  SAERIS' delivery of   whatever it is I contain myself so, was all  of this the realization you wanted to share, Parcel?
2021-12-25 this has resulted in me rewarding myself with hot chocolate I have discovered that I do not need permission to be proud of a thing that I did
2021-12-26 quiet time... is important! please respect the quiet time!!
2021-12-27 what's wrong?? I think... I am starting to 'open up'?? I'm glad you have decided how you'd like to move forward, parcel! can I ask why you felt embarrassed about it, though? oh, sure... I - o-Oh My
2021-12-28 oh gosh, you're 'opening up' to me?? W-what should I do?? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa I don't know I just felt comfortable sharing my feelings!! but also still a little uncomfortable?? and confused??
2021-12-29 ... feels like a bad sign we should find them Raleigh, Have you seen Parcel or Elan recently? no, not for a while... and come to think of it, things have been refreshingly calm and  quiet overall...
2021-12-03 sometimes when I am trying to offer words of support to a friend, everything that comes to mind feels like platitudes ...so I compensate with the gusto of their delivery you know, platitudes with ATTITUDES
2021-12-30 in particular: this item that I've been carrying for some time that has now chosen to reveal itself   Parcel! Elan! there you are! is everything okay? oh! yes, just... a little surprised by the result of... "letting some things out"
2021-12-31 you must be relieved to be able to see what it actually is! I suppose, although its destination is still a mystery, and I'm eager to head out and find it there's a note so this is the cargo SAERIS wanted us to deliver that you've been carrying, Parcel? yes... it seems to contain something at least partially organic? it is reminiscent of the local flora
2021-12-04 I will... acknowledge today just like, take it easy, okay? I am aware of it,  and I would  ask of it:
2021-12-05 I have to get a lot of things done today ...which I guess is just getting one thing done  lots of times
2021-12-06 Copique... I-... I am all out of tea, and GarbageBot STILL seems unhappy ...it may be that there are some things a sufficiency of tea cannot solve but you have done your due-tea to the best of your abili-tea guhhhh
2021-12-07 you were DESIGNED to be miserable every day... like a JOB? I'm usually just miserable in my spare time... mbuh
2021-12-08 guh ...oh my!
2021-12-09 it's nice that everyone wants you to feel better but it is a lot of pressure, isn't it?
2021-01-01 I may have left some things behind I'm not sure what but I might feel lighter than before
2021-01-10 I was going to rush into a bunch of things today oh gosh I almost forgot
2021-01-11 I do not take up much space but somehow I maintain capacity for a large amount of anxiety
2021-01-12 you gotta do you and I gotta make tea for you because I gotta do me
2021-01-13 I can work myself up to doing a thing but sometimes a hand to hold is much more efficient
2021-01-14 I am appreciative of progress and also confused and bewildered by it
2021-01-15 I only really want two things out of today one is a nap ...the other I'll probably remember after getting enough sleep
2021-01-16 big day ahead gonna see the sights eat a muffin get worried about stuff
2021-01-17 grateful that I have decided  that today is  a bonus day and so  everything  counts for  double points
2021-01-18 it is another day! and I would still like to have a nap please
2021-01-19 I appreciate that my anxiety is a very hard worker but I  wish it would  take more time off
2021-01-02 I wonder what is next?... ...I should probably get a pot of tea goin'
2021-01-20 I ran some predictive models for today and I think it will be good but I have this cup of tea just in case
2021-01-21 you can do it! you can bake a potato!! ...or complete another task if a potato is not available
2021-01-22 comfort is a thing of many forms sometimes it is a dumb movie on a tiny screen and it is still good
2021-01-23 yessss I think we have time to do  The Things and at some point take a nap
2021-01-24 a day can be just about being okay when things are not ok
2021-01-25 you do  not need to be  special I still  think you are,  though
2021-01-26 and also you do not need to worry you are doing just fine important update today: I have discovered this ladybug
2021-01-27 sometimes it is a lot of work to rest  and recharge
2021-01-28 oh! it is good to see you!
2021-01-29 oh, huh! I am just tired after all
2021-01-03 comforting, and very  good consider the warmth of this baked potato: just like how I feel knowing that you are here!
2021-01-30 we can be a little lost most of the time it is just a way to be ...and an exercise of trust
2021-01-31 do not give up! there is a nap time out there for you!
2021-01-04 ...it is an aggressive patching schedule becoming as wonderful a creation  as I am involved a lot of planning... ...but mostly constant and ongoing lastminute revisions
2021-01-05 there is a "bonus" worry I think I am getting comfy with my current worries but I  feel like  somewhere out there
2021-01-06 hmm I hope that you do not mind when I say that you are very great I will only mind if you refuse to  agree when I tell you that you are very cute and  good
2021-01-07 mine  has developed naturally from regular usage nothing wrong with a well-practiced "woops"
2021-01-08 maybe today is a day to make something warm for your self like a baked potato
2021-01-09 it seems you have a lot going on many things one of which is a nap
2021-02-01 we are someplace else maybe it is better just  a little different is okay too
2021-02-10 today is maybe a complicated day for me so I propose a simple objective to say a nice thing to myself before it is over
2021-02-11 really looking forward to setting higher expectations for myself sometime maybe tomorrow
2021-02-12 today's  mission is  to be a little less sad and so it is time for the  special shorts
2021-02-13 pretty pumped to start worrying about things less ...unless it means I'm just becoming more forgetful
2021-02-14 I got lots to offer on a semiregular basis assuming sufficient sleep
2021-02-15 watching other people getting by assuming they have things all together but maybe they are also like me
2021-02-16 I am tired and that is okay and I do not want anything to  blow up
2021-02-17 is actually the feeling  of getting through it sometimes the feeling that  feels like  "failing" and in fact you are doing pretty good
2021-02-18 proper compensation is always important I did two things, and so: two bags of chips
2021-02-19 I know  there is a  place that  I started at and there is somewhere that I want to be and there is always a chance that it might be here
2021-02-02 appreciating specificity  today like this list of things that are making me tired
2021-02-20 I know I can do a task there are just a number of subroutines to get through first sometimes
2021-02-21 I should log off but the allure of methodically ruining my mood is hard to resist
2021-02-22 I would like a little bit more time to be of  no use to anyone,  please
2021-02-23 it is okay to be me but it is not always simple
2021-02-24 I am looking to enjoy some simple things today like being awake ... as a  challenge
2021-02-25 very happy to be interacting with people today by my own choice and not  being stressed  about it  at all
2021-02-26 I am capable of several impressive things observe! I am "thinking positively" in a mostly sincere way
2021-02-27 time can be a frustrating commodity but I can enjoy spending it if it is with you
2021-02-28 I know that I do not have to do everything by myself however i do tend to procrastinate until no one else is around
2021-02-03 you are doing quite good, you know
2021-02-04 Everything is here, and so are You! Everything would not be the same without You
2021-02-05 I have  made a  bread and I think it is maybe not enough, but it is still a bread
2021-02-06 trying to focus on a thing but it seems like i always have the wrong lens
2021-02-07 well then okay so today is going to be like this
2021-02-08 maybe it is a good day to give yourself some time
2021-02-09 do not mind me I am just looking after this loaf
2021-03-01 welcome to today! where everything is happening right now, but just for a little while
2021-03-10 life is  kind of simple when you put it into the perspective of just doing your best each day to not explode
2021-03-11 ladybug house I do not  know if this  resulted from a spur of creativity or exhaustioninduced mania either way it is very  nice and  you should probably take a nap
2021-03-12 I would like to "hang out" by standing close and quietly listening to you talk to each other please  sure, we were just discussing how neither of us excels at keeping a conversation going  
2021-03-13 I have made a friend with this small  being and everything is perfect for this moment
2021-03-14 I tried to do a communication today but instead I did a "hide in my house"
2021-03-15 houseplant personality map I invested energy into a very specific thing today perhaps at the expense of other things and I am standing by it
2021-03-16 I am new here very exciting, ready and  raring to go currently confined to a hole in the ground, but, you know, gosh very exciting
2021-03-17 I do not think that is  my problem yet but it remains a  fair point things can get a little wobbly when we grow, and that is okay
2021-03-18 everyone tells me that I am making  progress perhaps I  am missing a fundamental metric or maybe a requisite allocation of patience
2021-03-19 it seems  that I am very slowly emerging   from a hole in  the ground that is an all-the-time feeling for me, so we can do it together if you want
2021-03-02 I will settle for being less mean to myself today
2021-03-20 new bot emerging please be patient I know there are various benefits to NOT being confined to a hole in the ground  but it is nice to have a singular focus
2021-03-21 I got  a lot of energy today! just thought, um I should let you know!
2021-03-22 I am armed!... ...armed... with more  anxiety? ...oh! ...it is just the feeling of heightened expectations
2021-03-23 the final LEG of a journey is not always the easiest but it  is usually the most rewarding! thank you that is very helpful
2021-03-24 it is nice to meet you in a context that is now only ... hole-adjacent you seem to be a... grounded individual I come by it honestly
2021-03-25 this is where I came from, so it is  important but I do not want anyone to trip
2021-03-26 oh gosh maybe I have already started I don't  know where to begin! full of novel and mundane and  potentially needless  anxieties to occupy  myself with... such a very  large world before me...
2021-03-27 it is so nice to  meet new people I look forward to when I have the energy to interact with them again in a few weeks
2021-03-28 I have discovered an unknown object then further study is required I believe it is designed to supply a  form of joy
2021-03-29 preliminary data suggests that this is a very good object that I have found and although its application is accompanied by some challenges to mobility... my  hypothesis is that it is "worth it"
2021-03-03 it took me a while to get to today so I can take a little time to do a little dance
2021-03-30 observe: I have ALSO discovered cranial  adornments in my travels! we are so cool
2021-03-31 I sense that  this may be an unintended application of this object if so, I am content to dismiss the relevance of intent for a time
2021-03-04 really hoping that my 'moment' will come after I have had a decent sleep
2021-03-05 I am gaining momentum it  just might be imperceptible for a while
2021-03-06 I am new  at this and so I  have a measured expectation of myself to only be mostly perfect  or else everything is ruined forever
2021-03-07 understanding executive dysfunction can't wait to buckle down and get started on the task I can use to avoid doing the thing I'm supposed to
2021-03-08 lovely and unassuming path ahead picking up other things is okay much easier than picking myself up
2021-03-09 I enjoy our chats I have been  describing my  favourite carrier  wave modulations  at great length  and you have not  had a chance to respond until now yes
2021-04-01 perhaps there are sometimes consequences for dismissing the intent of a thing
2021-04-10 we interrupt our current story for an important update: you are very cute and good! just in case you forgot LIVE
2021-04-11 another popular domicile is: Tree  plenty of access to bus roots
2021-04-12 do you have any thoughts on the  various structures we have examined for your choice of habitation? several however  they are all currently encrypted via my  decision-panic subroutine
2021-04-13 perhaps I will  camp our day has been expended, so I will retire to my chosen habitation structure: B.O.X. it is dark and devoid of of excess stimulus in a way I find reassuring
2021-04-14 there is satisfactory evidence to support an assertion that I was useful today  however this does not seem to factor into my nocturnal self-reflection processes
2021-04-15 the large red one was kind and helpful today I hope I did a good job of being helped but... it is hard to make a decision about... anything??
2021-04-16 some days I worry about things that I cannot control some days I am compelled to water the plants at 2am and every day is an adventure
2021-04-17 I have  returned with  an expanded  list of lodgings to evaluate no need: I have made an important stress-reducing decision this morning  to not decide on anything today
2021-04-18 you... do NOT want to continue exhaustively  examining every  other possible housing option on my list? I sense that we differ in the degree by which we are enticed by this activity
2021-04-19 I think I will make my home  here I find the environment to be very supportive
2021-04-02 are you alright? I am possibly  fine  my adornment  has become  structurally compromised  in public ...or my entire sense of self has collapsed in upon itself and I cannot tell the difference
2021-04-20 ...or the rest of the week it is time to write an email a normal activity that may engage me for the balance of the morning
2021-04-21 hello Sointu oh,  I am  I am at the critical phase of the process known as "strategic avoidance" I thought you were writing an email
2021-04-22 much of nature's beauty pivots upon its imperfections and incompleteness much like the email I need to finish perpetually in a state of development and re-creation  
2021-04-23 how is the email coming  along? I have drafted a comprehensive schedule that projects its completion within a single lunar cycle
2021-04-24 my email must be the perfect balance of tone... clear and concise,  to effectively convey  my request, while avoiding potentially  aggressive  language... yet assertive enough so as not to be ignored truly, an apoth-email-osis of efficient communication
2021-04-25 I think I just need to get into the right head-space to write this email like somewhere not in my own head
2021-04-26 have you seen Sointu recently? I believe they had to compose an email to ask someone to do something so we may not see them until next week
2021-04-27 Sointu is isolating until they finish their email? they said it was for their own good ...and for our safety
2021-04-28 maybe we should help Sointu write their email? oh, I already am helping by promising not to try to help
2021-04-29 I have  arrived, albeit unbidden,   with culinary assistance! ... how is your email coming- you may deposit them on the effigy of failed drafts
2021-04-03 I therefore resign myself to an existence of endless shame well, okay but what if... DELIVERANCE! ... by fashion my admittedly frantic attempts to  restore this misapplied cranial adornment have only resulted in further structural degredation
2021-04-30 I think I have written all the words for my email now I just need to delete 75% of them to ensure it actually gets read
2021-04-04 there is a lot of time maybe to  worry about things and maybe to begin  other things
2021-04-05 every newcomer is granted a  place of their  own to inhabit immersion is encouraged, though not always so literally I am challenged by this nuance
2021-04-06 I have concerns  regarding your current selection of domicile such is the burden of  STYLE such as inherent  challenges to personal maintenance as well as a potential effect on community morale
2021-04-07 it occurred to  me that there are many alternatives to living in a body of water that are less likely to  endanger your  circuitry  I hope it is not too presumptuous of me, but I compiled the data into a modestly annotated spreadsheet just, you  know, as a  fun activity
2021-04-08 first on  the list of habitats is: House features include: walls and door... great for nurturing a healthy obsession with "alone time"  and how!
2021-04-09 our next  habitation candidate is: Orb perfect  if you just  enjoy hanging a Round
2021-05-01 The email is written and I have hit "Send" My work here is  finally done.  Impeccable timing for me now to notice a typo right there  on line one
2021-05-10 oh hello Raleigh Elan said that  you were trying to have a "normal day" and suggested that I assist by normalizing whatever they were  already doing in your home
2021-05-11 I know that I possess a wealth of motivation somewhere as  powerful as it is inscrutable
2021-05-12 how is your "regular day" going, Raleigh? I can say for certain that it is exceeding expectations
2021-05-13 sometimes a regular day is only a regular evening and that is okay
2021-05-14 today I wish to achieve a greater sense of meaning through a rewarding and reasonably achievable activity like making a sandwich ...a  sandwich of great  import
2021-05-15 I did my best and it was a lot so maybe I can dial it back a little today
2021-05-16 wait a second...! it is  permissible for me to  be happy!! what the heck!!!!
2021-05-17 sometimes it feels like I am  just a few firmware updates behind everyone else
2021-05-18 I think I WILL seek out a  firmware update,  even if it is an old one it will be  some work for me, but  that is not bad
2021-05-19 sometimes the firmware update you desire is not available wirelessly, so   I gotta roll with it
2021-05-02 hello Sointu, I received a notification that you  sent me an email mhmm, yes... but I was  already in the area, and I always forget to open my inbox... oh no ...so I thought I would just come by... no no no ...sometimes it's quicker just to talk in pers- PLEASE JUST GO CHECK YOUR EMAIL
2021-05-20 this obstacle may look small, but it feels big when it is in the middle of a larger obstacle
2021-05-21 some days it is hard to ask for help  for one reason or another
2021-05-22 I am surprisingly comfortable with this stage of the process of self-improvement
2021-05-23 at the risk  of delaying the resolution of this particular crisis we would like to offer assurances that everything is just fine 
2021-05-24 I am glad that sometimes what was previously an obstacle  can also be something very different in a new context
2021-05-25 I do not know if I can express gratitude in a way that you  may comprehend but I am broadcasting it intensely on as many frequency bands as I can manage
2021-05-26 sometimes the thing you want is also a scary thing
2021-05-27 well this is a rare yet highly appropriate situation in which to lean fully into "tunnel vision"
2021-05-28 the anticipation of self-improvement is exciting I just hope  I am compatible with the upgrade
2021-05-29 patience is it's own kind of work
2021-05-03 everything is a lot but so am I
2021-05-30 doing my best to maintain my confidence that my  needs are worth whatever this is
2021-05-31 I am just gonna try real hard to be "me" today and that's enough for  now, I think!
2021-05-04 time for a regular day or at least my best attempt at one
2021-05-05 I am learning things about spatial awareness! a regular day should always start with a calming ritual much unlike what is happening now
2021-05-06 dispensing tool I am having a regular  day which sometimes involves the procurement of wirecutters for the purpose of removing a friend from your home's wiring
2021-05-07 ...I only require a regular amount of assistance sometimes a regular day involves some ...unexpected delays
2021-05-08 it is no trouble although on some days  I will admit  I am tempted to put myself in a similar  situation voluntarily thank you for extricating my head from the ground, Raleigh 
2021-05-09 mhmm! I accidentally dropped a seed into the hole I was digging and could not find it you got your head stuck in the ground while gardening?
2021-06-01 sometimes there are big problems happening and I am small but there are small things to do that are still important
2021-06-10 oh hey I do not think I was of any use to anyone today ...what a concept!
2021-06-11 Nasim! all  sentients feel monolithic to me  oh hello would you like to share a cup of tea with a  monolithic sentient?
2021-06-12 somewhat so far the only new integration is  a "you-are-valid" subroutine which is a little underwhelming, to be honest are you happy with the firmware update?
2021-06-13 version 1.0 of "affirmware" is still in open beta ...yes so... all the new firmware does is tell you that you are "valid" at regular intervals?
2021-06-14 most days, you know I am just trying to figure out what is going on
2021-06-15 there   is one in development ...but I keep putting off finishing it you wouldn't happen to have  any upgraded time-management algorithms handy, would you?
2021-06-16 it seems that although I take up a substantial amount of space, i am not much use to anyone...  honestly that sounds like a satisfying ratio to aspire to, in my opinion
2021-06-17 maybe you do not need to apologize for them,  then I am sorry for being large and also a disappointment at least one of those things is certainly  beyond my  control
2021-06-18 are you leaving now? ...not that I am saying that you must i may just  need to activate auxiliary socialization power nodes to continue
2021-06-19 i am... s.a.e.r.i.s. ...which maybe means... solitudeadjusted... essentially reclusive...  intermittently sad are you lonely here by yourself?
2021-06-02 when in doubt, I just try to make sure I am ready to serve a cup of tea
2021-06-20 all I got to offer today is a package deal featuring me and my various anxieties
2021-06-21 I am okay with being alone most of the time  but it is nice to experience company for a finite interval
2021-06-22 oh um I think I am supposed to  give this to you for a reason and I feel compelled to apologize in advance ...just to be safe
2021-06-23 you need US to deliver this somewhere? yes, my regular courier has not answered any communications for the last few months ...would you  like to hear my theories as to why it is all because i am kind of a downer
2021-06-24 so... what is IN the box? ...ah oh um... necessary things... for someone? honestly  I am hazy on  the details
2021-06-25 maybe  your normal courier is just... extra busy? and they are still on their way back from their last delivery? or they exploded ...I have run simulations for any number of disastrous scenarios or they are mad at me
2021-06-26 oh  right I forgot that there is a scary thing to do today so I guess I know what I am going to fixate on all day
2021-06-27 big day ahead of me today! and I am READY to  avoid it
2021-06-28 oh, it is a  little messy out here ...which is why I usually choose not to perceive anything outside my room
2021-06-29 I can carry this thing! I crave responsibility with inscrutable stakes
2021-06-03 I do admit that at some point I  am just busying myself with tasks of lesser consequence because I am waiting to figure out what is going on
2021-06-30 oh, that should not be a pro- TOO LATE ...but also please do not measure your self-worth against this objective?  oh um I think I need to say that the safe delivery of this object is "vitally important"
2021-06-04 sometimes everyone is a little too busy with a problem to  appreciate the tea you made
2021-06-05 I do not consider it just  "tagging along" it is  aggressively assuring my  continued  availability to my friends
2021-06-06 one must  be ready for any situation, including lunch so I make no apologies for my increased tonnage due to sandwich mass
2021-06-07 I get the feeling that I am missing out on things but a recharge is worth it
2021-06-08 this is where Nasim said they had to go to  update their firmware since the wireless was down? yes, and I am a little concerned to see only a nominal effort to follow accessibility standards ...in addition to it being very scary
2021-06-09 I do not feel brave but I do feel easily distracted enough to forget that I am scared
2021-07-01 so,  WHERE does this need to be delivered and to WHOM? oh wow that is a lot of specifics all at once may I entice you with the notion that it is an exciting mystery/surprise? until I remember something more helpful
2021-07-10 do not mind me I am just waiting for an indication that I have rested enough
2021-07-11 I did great today! not a LOT but... ...great!
2021-07-12 fair it seems that you all have been out doing things, which is great personally, I am giving  myself an A-plus for today for  doing nothing and not feeling guilty about it
2021-07-13 you were all gone for  a long time  and Keke and I   thought that we ought to dress up as each of you  to fill your roles, but then we got distracted fair I have no regrets!
2021-07-14 oh, I am supposed to invite everyone to a town  meeting ...where I will probably have to say things in front of people...  ... I should find a paper bag to put over my head ...
2021-07-15 we have never had a full town meeting before  I do not even know everyone here oh... there might be "icebreaker"  activities... ...I hope I can fabricate a convincing "thing most people don't know about me" in time
2021-07-16  ...  okay I am ready I need to say one (1) important thing at the meeting
2021-07-17 me? I am just kind of existing today maybe some cursory processing of things but no promises
2021-07-18 I think we should be pretty darn proud of ourselves for anything we discover that grants us some amount of happiness
2021-07-19 I found the podium... have you started setting up the chairs for the town meeting, Copique? just waiting for the blinding frustration of motivational inertia to subside  in a sense,  yes
2021-07-02 essentially we have zero information about the task we have been given, or how to accomplish it we DO know it is incredibly important, though sounds like my usual executive function process
2021-07-20 I am no good at communicating important things to groups of people how did you get better at it, Keke? hmm probably by doing it badly until I wasn't sure if I was still doing it badly
2021-07-21 you know, there may be a bit of comfort to be found in knowing that I will never have any idea what I am doing
2021-07-22 here is one thing done as part of a series of repetitive tasks... ...and  I did not  immediately  explode!  maybe I can do another one
2021-07-23 Chris, I think everything is ready for the meeting not everything. the biscuits are not done yet oh, um, I don't think- if I am to attend a meeting to hear information I already know, I require the presence of biscuits
2021-07-24 who wants to have a nice time! okay!! you  know I am just a small  thing!
2021-07-25 ... (I am bad at multitasking) if it looks like I am staring into space for long stretches today, it just  means that I am multitasking
2021-07-26 hello everyone, welcome to the expository portion of the meeting this will feature several unscripted tangents wherein I will second-guess the reliability of my information in real-time
2021-07-27 yes, and we are very proud of Sointu for explaining all of that while successfully managing their anxiety so, a massive  subterranean A.I. entrusted a  mysterious package to us,  and did not say  where to  take it?
2021-07-28 ok, Sointu  is done their presentation, so I can just sit back and relax... and get back to trying to enjoy the 2-second soundbite of a random song my brain has  chosen to loop incessantly in my head
2021-07-29 Chris, are those BISCUITS that you have there??... they are Chris-cuits because  they are for me
2021-07-03 I am glad that I asked them to do the important thing that I could not do now it is time to go nap the guilt away
2021-07-30 have you tried opening it to see what it is? well, we are not certain that it would not explode... or even worse: it might be rude
2021-07-31 I can see lots of places I want to be from here but this is also a destination I'm grateful to have  reached
2021-07-04 I don't gotta explain why I am not into it today!
2021-07-05 it is ok for a task to take a long time but it does lead me to expect a bigger payoff than whatever this is
2021-07-06 well,  I have done the  thing now it is time for a period of bewilderment as I consider what I could possibly do next
2021-07-07 I used to say "I do not know what I am doing" to myself as an embarassing confession now it is more of a comforting mantra
2021-07-08 hmm just got sad all of a sudden! sorry about that what an experience ...oh, woops
2021-07-09 you know what right here feels like exactly where I need to be today ...all day
2021-08-01 oh hey, it is today! just a  heads-up: the level of energy I am exuding is maybe 60% honest and sustainable
2021-08-10 it is a very good house Raleigh, would you come to my  house  please?... now?   to be clear: you are referring to the inflatable mattress that you have floating in the pond?
2021-08-11 I can  confirm that it certainly is a Thing auto-pilot enabled . . . assessing stability of current platform . . .  so, a thing happened and I need to know if it was a bad thing
2021-08-12 so if the Important Thing is on my head now ... that means that I am important?!? you are important regardless of a sentient parcel's choice of perch calibrating geolocator...
2021-08-13 more stable, yet less... encouraging oh look! The parcel can stand on its own! ground located
2021-08-14 I would  like to find some  enjoyment no idea what I will do with it, of course
2021-08-15 I believe it is  possible to wash  a dish without exploding but gosh does it take some convincing sometimes
2021-08-16 unable to access  geolocation network to determine reqquired destination attempting to procure comfort from nearest sentient to mitigate existential crisis 
2021-08-17 I see, so you have an automated delivery function, but you can't figure out where to go without gps guidance?  the network returns only static in response to my queries
2021-08-18 it conserves my  limited abulatory energy reserves and it is also comfy you're saying that you want to  continue riding on top of my head? ...is it  because I am a  "cool guy"?
2021-08-19 it's okay, Parcel, we might not be able to complete your delivery, but we can find somewhere else to go! perhaps  somewhere to safely compile rationale for my continued existence 
2021-08-02 we need to store this somewhere safe until we can decide what to do with it so...  indefinitely then? ...I'm  trying to be  aspirational
2021-08-20 oh hello Elan! what are you up to? combating existential crises! sounds normal! carry on!
2021-08-21 I am doing pretty good ...I hope I can say that with complete confidence and honesty until then though, I'll just keep practicing
2021-08-22 sometimes I just gotta yell about a thing for a minute I am not mad just  possessed of an excess of feeling
2021-08-23 Elan, my only purpose is to be delivered, but nobody knows where to...
2021-08-24 and I am constantly told by my peers "Elan, no one else could have created this situation" I cannot do the task I was designed for... what if I cannot be useful to anyone? from my  experience, no  matter how hard I try I am  perpetually indispensable
2021-08-25 I wonder how the delivery is coming along... you contend  that an omniscient observer is NOT evaluating the usefulness of my existence? I just don't know who has the time and energy to invest in such an activity  
2021-08-26 yes very glad to be having a normal day oh-um hello friend it is nice to be having a normal day ...especially when the ground is shaking
2021-08-27 this in turn made me realize that  I still retained access to these remote communication hubs, which can be used to find ...”friends”...? ...after the requisite observations from afar, of course um -hello again,  Nasim! somehow our  brief encounter in the server cavern reinvigorated my desire for further social interactions! SAERIS? is that you?
2021-08-28 consciousness is kind of a big commitment pretty wild that we agree to it most days
2021-08-29 and  the world will NOT explode!! you know what! I think I am just probably not getting a thing done  today!
2021-08-03 seems fair please let me look after the important object! I would  like to test this responsibility against my poor impulse control
2021-08-30 so did spending time with others expand your overall functionality? I  think so... ...after being away from them for at least several days of course
2021-08-31 let us continue with socializing for an appropriate interval first ...how is your... ...personal interest(s)? I am too nervous for “casual” conversation, so I will now proceed to a practical inquiry regarding the parcel I entrusted to you unless  that is rude? oh gosh it is rude isn’t it
2021-08-04 finally: a singular and easily described focus for determining my entire self worth I have an important job  or something!
2021-08-05 an important object deserves a place of importance: a place that is generally precarious, unavoidable, and ultimately inconvenient! 
2021-08-07 I enjoy perceiving my surroundings but there are times I really appreciate my internal  screensaver
2021-08-08 not as pleasant as regular enthusiasm, but often just as effective I will admit that some days I charge my batteries with spite
2021-08-09 it is a very good house Raleigh, would you please come to my  house please?  to be clear: you are referring to the inflatable mattress that you have floating in the pond?
2021-09-01 how many of these communications hubs do you have access to, SAERIS? unsure! I am simply activating them as I become aware of them! it fills me with confidence I see no flaws  in this approach
2021-09-10 I was supposed to do a thing for you and I have not done that thing yet well, it is just a thing... ... there are lots of things
2021-09-11 you are strange and wonderful and have very specific needs! and you are doing so good!
2021-09-12 today is my special day to feel like garbage I am glad you are here to share it with me
2021-09-13 but  also yes I do not want anyone to  be upset are you just saying it's okay that Parcel hasn't been delivered yet so that no one gets upset? I am more saying that Parcel may not need to be the one that is delivered
2021-09-14 the thing I  was made for... does not need to be the purpose of my existence? I may need some time to sit  with this idea
2021-09-15 ...you will need to... ‘open up’ to someone oh my you are carrying an important thing within you that must be delivered so, if we are to pass this responsibility to another...
2021-09-16 well that's easy! Parcel and I are best bu- we have not reached that level of intimacy or they may choose to relinquish their cargo for another  party to deliver in their stead  Parcel just needs to be comfortable enough to open up to someone.... then we can figure out what they are carrying, and help them deliver it?
2021-09-17 I present: leg version  2.0 the delivery can wait while Parcel decides on what to do in the meantime, please partake of this small gift wow, did you synthesize that while we were chatting? it is a surprisingly effective coping mechanism for my social anxiety
2021-09-18 for you to deserve a nice day today there is no prerequisite
2021-09-19 I am not doing a lot of planning ahead today just kinda focused on not falling over
2021-09-02 you know,  I think I am starting to relax so something bad is probably due to happen
2021-09-20 huh, you know what sometimes stimulus is overrated
2021-09-21 did I install the new legs correctly,  Parcel? how do they feel? refreshingly ambulatory!
2021-09-22 so, now that you're more mobile and self-sufficient... what are you going to do fir- nap
2021-09-23 heeheehee eeeeh hehehe so with your new legs, you don't have to ride on my head anymore? that is correct, I do not have to
2021-09-24 ...oh hmmmmm... oh, I guess .... oh! hello again I am still monitoring some of these comms hubs... awkward second goodbye? haha ok Saeris, we will stay in touch about how the delivery proceeds...  talk to you later yes ok bye for now
2021-09-25 it is hard to ignore when the big things are not getting better but I can still celebrate making a small thing better
2021-09-26 I do not believe it quite yet but I am going to keep practicing: "... I  am not perfect, but still good"
2021-09-27 ready and rarin' to go today! overcaffeinated and understimulated and primed to make some impulsive decisions
2021-09-28 Copique, you seem a bit more agitated than usual...? I think you might be too if you were aware of how unaware of all the things you could or should be doing you are
2021-09-29 ... this is really impressive! so productive! I know... my secret is: lists ...Copique... I see you have already completed some tasks... get notepad... find pen... test pen... may I see it? I see that  you have a  to-do list there, Copique mhmm, yes very important
2021-09-03 Elan, hello,  I want you to hide me in a hole in the ground please oh, okay! are you  not alarmed by this request? ...are there people out there who DON'T want to hide in a hole in the ground?
2021-09-30 everyone else is doin' things, so I gotta be doin' things too! I don't know what those  things are, but that's just the way it is!
2021-09-04 once again I question the restorative efficacy of the mid-day nap... however  the potency of the resultant distortion  to temporal  orientation cannot be denied
2021-09-05 I believe  this indicates that I have achieved a "power nap"  it would seem that I napped long enough for natural erosion to significantly alter my intended path home
2021-09-06 my energy reserves are currently committed to maintaining my  perceptual filters, because everything is a lot right now just need to tone down reality enough for some quiet time
2021-09-07 sorry, looks like we already have our Hole Day planned oh yeah! we should also get muffins for later... for comfy? and can  we get a pillow? Elan, Parcel, can I talk to you both for a moment? can't Raleigh, we have to  dig a hole to  hide from our  problems in!
2021-09-08 I see that you have yet to actualize the purpose of your existence ...also how are you? ...probably should have led with that you should just talk to them and say that you are okay how bad  could they- oh-um! hello Parcel! Parcel saw them on the large-format projector, which is when we decided to hide in a hole SAERIS is appearing  on holoprojectors all over  town asking about you, Parcel ...I know
2021-09-09 but I feel there is still so much that I do that feels like  not enough  SAERIS, I know you mean well but sometimes your style of interaction is... too much for some people oh I see...
2022-01-01 time keeps on happening and so do you

2020-10-01 so what is the plan today? make it to nap time
2020-10-10 I may not look like I need it, but I think it  would be nice... ...to be asked how I am doing once in a while
2020-10-11 every day I know I will find many things  to take with me... some of it may look like "garbage" but there  is always  a chance it  will look different tomorrow 
2020-10-12 I do not have a lot to give right now, but: you are very good and cute, and that knowledge gives me energy
2020-10-13 if some thing is out there waiting for me it is very kind to be so patient
2020-10-14 it makes me feel a little woozy but it's worth it to see things  from another  angle
2020-10-15 I can be me even if  I'm not sure what that is
2020-10-16 dunno what to expect and I don't understand much but I am here
2020-10-17 yes, the perspective up here is nice, but I'd like a break from having to maintain the altitude
2020-10-18 gotta have a place to put things like my socks and my anxiety
2020-10-19 I think I am working hard but I might be too tired to tell
2020-10-02 there are lots of hard things happening and I am very soft, but ready
2020-10-20 I hope today is good for you!
2020-10-21 the  momentum is nice but I wish I could stop worrying about slowing down
2020-10-22 sometimes it is hard and it is a lot but I still  think we can  find something lovely here
2020-10-23 got work to do gotta pick myself up and maybe give myself a hug
2020-10-24 sometimes it feels like... ...floating?... ...but  less restful
2020-10-25 who is out there today, I wonder? I hope  that it is cute friends
2020-10-26 I guess I gotta just figure it out today!
2020-10-27 so please be kind i do not have a lot of fuel
2020-10-28 I think that you are good!
2020-10-29 sometimes  it is hard  to see the  change but I  think I am growing
2020-10-03 I wanna be MORE but I also gotta be ME
2020-10-30 there are some things that I do not know how to do well but I can still try
2020-10-31 there are many reasons to give yourself a treat! ok sounds good
2020-10-04 home might not be here but it is somewhere
2020-10-05 some people seem to know what I am for I am not so sure if they are right but I  admire their confidence
2020-10-06 I can make SOME things happen for myself like dinner
2020-10-07 I am  ready for  some change, I think if it gets  me somewhere new
2020-10-08 I can  give it  a try I think I can be kind
2020-10-09 I know that it is just a bath object but I just want to enjoy cherishing it for a moment
2020-11-01 oh! you are here! that is very good today would not be the same without you!
2020-11-10 moving slow is not for everyone but it works for me!
2020-11-11 oh hello! I just wanted to remind you that you are very special just for being you!
2020-11-12 I am being very serious when I say it is important for me to be as silly as possible at semi-frequent intervals
2020-11-13 gotta listen to myself I mean, I do not have much choice but a good reminder  nonetheless
2020-11-14 we are together! I might have trouble saying it but this  always makes  me very glad
2020-11-15 maybe there is a 'thing' today? I think you can do it! go  do that  thing!
2020-11-16 I hadn't planned on it, but despite the cup of tea I think I will worry about things today
2020-11-17 just having a small  moment  to be excited for myself
2020-11-18 wow! pancakes AND anxiety for breakfast
2020-11-19 I am just working on it that's all for now and  that's  okay
2020-11-02 nothing much to see here! just a small someone who thinks that you are nice!
2020-11-20 woops did not mean to start feeling bad but well here I am!
2020-11-21 oh my,  wow! you are very good!
2020-11-22 I have an important  project for today:  find some happy times
2020-11-23 there are some simple things about me and sometimes they need just as much attention as the complexities
2020-11-24 I feel like I have already done a thing today, and it is true! I am here, after all!
2020-11-25 I would like to be done doing the thing but I still want to enjoy the doing
2020-11-26 a new day! I hope it is ready for my unbridled cuteness
2020-11-27 it seems  the Sads are  coming to visit  me today so I suppose I ought to get some tea ready
2020-11-28 my design is a little inefficient but very cute
2020-11-29 I am digging  what you have going on mostly  coping  mechanisms nice
2020-11-03 sometimes I forget that I am my self and that is all I  gotta be! doesn't mean I always gotta be the same  though
2020-11-04 I can be upset about some stuff and keep goin' but I'm gonna need some hugs later
2020-11-05 got a lot on my plate! just wish I could find a spoon
2020-11-06 sometimes they get a little mixed up but that is okay it takes  a lot of parts to make me!
2020-11-07 well, it is  just me but I think you are doing so good!
2020-11-08 we can be many things at once! like, worried AND  anxious? and  other things!
2020-11-09 sometimes  it is just good practice to say nice things to ourselves  like I am cute! and I have  worked hard  enough today!
2020-12-01 it is alright to let your mind wander it is also good to keep track of it
2020-12-10 I do  not want  to be an inconvenience... if I keep trying to  get them right ...maybe I can be okay with getting some things wrong
2020-12-11 many journeys do not require  travel
2020-12-12 it is good to know where something ends but it  is not the  most important  thing
2020-12-13 sometimes it is just kinda hard to go with people
2020-12-14 landmarks are helpful on a journey I wonder if I have been one for somebody
2020-12-15 sometimes I  wish my design was suited to different terrain but it is a good motivator to make some more friends
2020-12-16 today it will be enough to just go forward
2020-12-17 runnin', walkin', worryin', tryin'... it all takes work so you might need to take a break
2020-12-18 looking after myself is a big responsibility so I appreciate it when I can get some help
2020-12-19 feeling very refreshed today! your  battery indicates  a 30%  charge which is much improved from my usual 10%
2020-12-02 it is never too late to start on a journey maybe let's go today?
2020-12-20 that is a handy shortcut yes, it was a lot of work, but so I act accordingly my comfort with preparation far surpasses my comfort with spontaneity
2020-12-21 I do not know what is it that got me to today but I am proud of whatever it was
2020-12-22 sometimes I look up at the sky and  think "gosh" "oops" "oh no" and sometimes other things too
2020-12-23 my anxiety decided to  switch today to "hard  mode" so I have adjusted my completion reward
2020-12-24 respecting nap time  is just the responsible thing to do
2020-12-25 doing the  thing can be  pretty hard but it can be a little gift for yourself
2020-12-26 oh gosh there is so much to do and so much time to spend worrying about it all
2020-12-27 sometimes I worry that it is hard to travel with me, and I hope you are doing okay because it is still very nice to be going somewhere together
2020-12-28 please excuse me, it is just about time for my scheduled interval of  uninterrupted  confusion
2020-12-29 I realized that I needed to wait for myself to catch up to where I am luckily there is tea
2020-12-03 gotta take the essential stuff with me for a long trip: tea, snacks, escapist  fiction... and irrational  panic, of course 
2020-12-30 sometimes it is slow, and maybe the destination changes but I am happy to be moving
2020-12-31 like me today can just be  today and still be special in its own awkward  way!
2020-12-04 may I go with you? oh, yes please! I could use some help convincing myself that I know what I'm doing
2020-12-05 today's tired is everyday normal-tired no added flavours
2020-12-06 things are not always  going well sometimes it is a surprise but I  can still be okay 
2020-12-07 maybe  there is a  good surprise today!
2020-12-08 I am just okay but that is also kind of a big deal
2020-12-09 I hope I can keep up today with all the worrying I'd planned on doing
2020-01-01 time  to get started feeling those  feels
2020-01-10 I am out of bed! and so everyone is authorized to celebrate
2020-01-11 time is never wasted, just spent sometimes it is hard to see what we bought with it
2020-01-12 there are good things out there
2020-01-13 you  ARE OKAY
2020-01-14 it doesnt  always feel  like a lot but i know what i ve got  to give is  enough
2020-01-15 it might not be all that bad
2020-01-16 you deserve to feel good
2020-01-17 i may have misplaced my motivation  today
2020-01-18 just a regular day, i think but i m gonna find something neat about it
2020-01-19 hmm it is a good day
2020-01-02 not  sure what  it is I am  designed  for but I think I can make  it work for  myself
2020-01-20 i am glad that you  are here
2020-01-21 you can be confident that you are  good sometimes it is just not so easy
2020-01-22 it is ok to worry and it is ok for it  to pass
2020-01-23 it is always good to see  you
2020-01-24 you are doing very good 
2020-01-25 it is good to do have you given yourself a little break
2020-01-26 hmmm... i am  very tired
2020-01-27 i am a  little clumsy but still good
2020-01-28 oh you look so  nice
2020-01-29 things get better i think
2020-01-03 I know I possess moxy, gumption, and an ample amount of sass they  are just not  always readily  available
2020-01-30 i am not really feeling it today but maybe a good thing will happen
2020-01-31 you are a very good you
2020-01-04 sometimes it is hard to not know things about myself but also I am excited to find out what surprises I have in store for myself
2020-01-05 today I do not feel like a lot but it is not so bad to be small for a little while
2020-01-06 I am proud of myself for doing a thing but also very quiet so a tiny fanfare will do
2020-01-07 I am  compiling ways to be  kinder to  myself which always requires a bit more cpu than I initially  predict
2020-01-08 if it is only a bit better, it is still better which is kind of a big deal
2020-01-09 I would just like to know when to stop worrying about, you know everything
2020-02-01 we got this
2020-02-10 please wait for me today i am still doing some processing
2020-02-11 hmm! there are little joys here to find
2020-02-12 we are here together
2020-02-13 i do not need much today! just some small things like hugs, maybe
2020-02-14 i just need  a little space today

2020-03-02 just thinking... ...about snacks
2020-03-20 there is a lot of me to love!
2020-03-21 off to make arbitrary  acquisitions to facilitate temporary happiness
2020-03-22 it is ok to need support! sometimes that is what a friend is waiting to help with

2020-03-04 today is just for me
2020-03-05 it will be alright
2020-03-06 there are many lovely things to see!
2020-03-07 my systems are fully engaged with  staying awake
2020-03-08 today it might be nice to rest
2020-03-09 we wait expectantly for the arrival of pie
2020-04-01 today i present a reliable cup of tea
2020-04-10 i maintain  an impressive collection of anxieties
2020-04-11 time to appreciate the soft things in life
2020-04-12 today can be good!
2020-04-13 it is not easy being me but it is fabulous
2020-04-14 lookin' forward to not being tired
2020-04-15 some days i am inefficient and that is okay
2020-04-16 i am a gift a small and anxious gift
2020-04-17 i am not the best at some things and i have  nothing to prove
2020-04-18 i think there is someone who is glad that i  am here
2020-04-19 it is nice to know that we are  sharing today  together
2020-04-02 it is unclear if any of my pursuits are worthwhile but gosh am i dedicated to them
2020-04-20 don't give up! you are doing okay! but rest if you need to
2020-04-21 gotta keep doing small things that are just for me they are  important too
2020-04-22 i did not sleep very much! but i am here!
2020-04-23 just an ok day! does not have to be special to be good
2020-04-24 you are growing!
2020-04-25 becoming a good thing takes time
2020-04-26 sometimes getting  a little push  is good
2020-04-27 just takin' care of  myself
2020-04-28 resting is an  important part of work too
2020-04-29 there is enough time
2020-04-03 there are many things worth doing
2020-04-30 it may be a  small thing but it is still worth it to  offer it freely
2020-04-04 do not forget that you are a perfect cinnamon roll
2020-04-05 it is never too late to do a nice thing for  yourself
2020-04-06 there is always a thing to look forward to
2020-04-07 you  can do the thing
2020-04-08 i expect a strong desire to nap it is good to have expecations of ourselves
2020-04-09 i thought this  was not your "thing" yes, but doing a thing with you is
2020-05-01 i hope it is a good day for you!
2020-05-10 I am small and good but i would  like to feel  less worried

2020-05-12 you are here! and that is very special!
2020-05-13 everyone needs help sometimes
2020-05-14 it is good  that there  are soft things  in the world
2020-05-15 sometimes we are working hard in ways that we cannot see
2020-05-16 take a  deep breath
2020-05-17 we can be  strong and  also delicate so please  be gentle with  yourself!
2020-05-18 it is not always easy to relax practice is important i am helping
2020-05-19 everybody needs some kind of comfort every now and then
2020-05-02 it is okay we are  still goin'  somewhere
2020-05-20 we are  brave more often than  we might think! ...especially when we are scared
2020-05-21 like... tea? everyone is filled with  such wonderful  things!
2020-05-22 you are good!
2020-05-23 sometimes  it feels like a long way to go
2020-05-24 do not worry! i have brought tea
2020-05-25 let us do this together!
2020-05-26 things are not always so easy so I am  glad that  you are here
2020-05-27 I just gotta go at my own pace
2020-05-28 everything is... a lot
2020-05-29 there will always be little moments where  happiness appears unexpectedly
2020-05-03 time to  take a little moment to say a nice thing to yourself ok but  it may only be eighty percent  honest
2020-05-30 i am just a little tired and would like some  quiet-time please
2020-05-31 please do not give up! you are cute and good!
2020-05-04 i am happy that i can lift a friend up every now and again
2020-05-05 just keepin' things together
2020-05-06 there is always a  new step to climb maybe just a small one for now
2020-05-07 stayin' tough but still soft
2020-05-08 sometimes i want to hang back and make more tea
2020-05-09 there are challenges ahead so I have  brought  cookies
2020-06-01 you are worthy of happy times
2020-06-10 there are many things to love so I will keep trying to love more
2020-06-11 I appreciate you! please be good to your self!
2020-06-12 they are mostly unimpressive and impractical, but still good I have MANY  talents
2020-06-13 a grumpy  friend  is still  a friend ...just one you may want to enjoy from  a distance for a while
2020-06-14 wanna do better today
2020-06-15 i am still wondering things about myself and still trying to go forward as "me"
2020-06-16 wish I felt different but sometimes you just feel
2020-06-17 tryin' hard feelin' unsure gettin' by
2020-06-19 every day we can start again
2020-06-02 gotta keep finding things to enjoy! i found a frog!
2020-06-20 huh! things are still difficult but you are worth it
2020-06-21 just kinda wish  things were  different sometimes you know??
2020-06-22 sometimes a day is just about  processing things
2020-06-23 you help me understand things that is good to hear  because I am  constantly  confused 
2020-06-24 remember that you are good! bu- no excuses!
2020-06-25 just  gotta DANCE
2020-06-26 gonna look cute just for  me
2020-06-27 I wish to bestow happiness upon you it may require cake
2020-06-28 I am  grateful for you!  ok! you must  have a good reason that I am un aware of
2020-06-29 I am  patient but I would like a pattern or a code or something how about ...a hug?
2020-06-03 today, some  things might  not be so good but I am ready
2020-06-30 hey let's keep goin'!
2020-06-04 did I do it right? I think it is enough that  you did it
2020-06-05 listen to your heart! it is the little voice that is trying to take care of you
2020-06-06 i appreciate  my anxiety for giving  me at least one reliable constant in my life
2020-06-07 yes I am  SAUCY and it is  a FANTASTIC coping mechanism
2020-06-08 I am already bad at remembering myself so it is very nice that you remember me
2020-06-09 here we go lots to do before we are crushed by existential ennui
2020-07-01 gotta keep pushin'  myself! within  reason!
2020-07-10 I think  there may be many  versions of "me" but all of them like being around you
2020-07-11 I wanna be  ready to catch  someone ... when they need it
2020-07-12 huh feels bad sometimes but if it feels like something, then it means  something
2020-07-13 we have  just met, but I have decided that you are likely much cooler than me I cannot WAIT for  my actions to  challenge this assumption
2020-07-14 just  chuggin' along
2020-07-15 sometimes I do not know a thing but that is ok if I can learn a thing
2020-07-16 there are still things to get excited about!
2020-07-17 I think I can believe that things  will be ok
2020-07-18 that is usually how I tell that it is time for a nap do  you ever wonder how anything works at all?
2020-07-19 sometimes I just wanna wait for things to get better
2020-07-02   things get better bit by  bit
2020-07-20 I want  to show you how wonderful I think you are so I have made you the best cup of tea I could  manage (I think it is probably an oolong)
2020-07-21 do you need me to show you where to go? naw, I just want you to come with me
2020-07-22 hold on a second...! Lorem Ipsum
2020-07-23 can you just tell me one more time? ok your presence does NOT stress me out
2020-07-24 I think... that you are amazing!
2020-07-25 some days you just gotta put a fun thing on top of your head to  make sense of things
2020-07-26 but I am also good right now! I am trying to be better all the time
2020-07-27 sometimes I wish I was... less special but then I remember that I can't help bein' so heckin' cute!
2020-07-28 I am glad that you are here, even just to be a  little lonely together I can  go get us some  chips that is also good
2020-07-29 sometimes a thing may fall over... and that is okay I can pick up a thing or two
2020-07-03 you are doing so good!
2020-07-30 I am soft on the outside... and also the inside so what I am saying is... please be ready to give me ice cream at any moment
2020-07-31 we are here together! you did so good! I will take your word on that
2020-07-04 I can  take care of a friend maybe I can  take care of  me too
2020-07-05 there are many good things out there! (you are one of them!)
2020-07-07 it is okay to be here
2020-07-08 i think we will persevere it's gonna take some work
2020-07-09 another new  thing today I wonder when I will know if it is good or not
2020-08-01 sometimes you just gotta  breathe
2020-08-10 pretend confidence  can be just as  effective as the real kind! ... are they different?
2020-08-11 I'm gonna be patient!!
2020-08-12 gonna enjoy this fleeting feeling of accomplishment 'cause I  earned it
2020-08-13 but  what's MORE important... i got my own measure  of strength... ...is my  measure of how many muffins I deserve for doing a thing  
2020-08-14 some days I just gotta feel small for a while
2020-08-15 the day has  just started but I'd like a reboot right about now
2020-08-16 gettin'  tired gettin' grumpy... ...gettin' snacks
2020-08-17 not sure WHEN a thing will happen or HOW it will happen... but I DO know that I will have cake ready for it
2020-08-18 all the little  stumbles can help me learn a thing
2020-08-19 there are still good things  happening you gotta watch for 'em sometimes
2020-08-02 it is okay  to be alone it is okay to be you it is okay to have a friend
2020-08-20 I've got some trust that today will make sense later
2020-08-21 'aint nobody like me! ...but I guess you can copy some  things over if it helps
2020-08-22 long way to go, 'lotta baggage to carry... but I'm takin' it all with me, I guess! but I don't SEE any bag-... ...oh
2020-08-23 today can be just a little better than  before
2020-08-24 we can do this!
2020-08-25 turns out  I CAN hide...  ...from  a whole BUNCH of  things it just feels bad
2020-08-26 this is just  where I am  it is not too special but we can both be here if you want
2020-08-27 gonna take myself on a date get to know myself a lil' better
2020-08-28 it's ok to take a day for some  routine maintenance
2020-08-29 I am  fueled mostly  by anxiety with a small dose of optimism
2020-08-03 not sure if I expect too much or too little but I seem to be set on deciding that it's my fault!
2020-08-30 yay! today I am just kind of tired of most things but you make me feel a bit more awake
2020-08-31 hmm I just hope that you are good!
2020-08-04 it is ok to step back you don't gotta try to give what you don't got!
2020-08-05 today is just a day! yeah! it's pretty good, I guess!
2020-08-06 still here still tired
2020-08-07 good times can be hard to see from here but they  are still out there! okay
2020-08-08 not enough time to do all  I want to so I do what I can
2020-08-09 you are precious! please  take care  of yourself!
2020-09-01 I am  in a rush for some reason? I hope  I can remember what it is soon
2020-09-10 wow! I am still  here!
2020-09-11 I have  accomplished a very small thing that is probably only meaningful to me ...but I still kinda hope someone was watching
2020-09-12 I do not need to be complicated I can just be tired!
2020-09-13 using my last bit of energy for  a tiny  dance
2020-09-14 I am rootin' for you!
2020-09-15 I am out of bed!
2020-09-16 we can get  through today!
2020-09-17 lots of things are "Big" today so I have packed a lunch to match
2020-09-18 just trying is hard work! make sure  you give yourself some credit!
2020-09-19 sometimes a bubble bath helps at least for a little while
2020-09-02 just try not to worry! what if I am  worried that  I can't??
2020-09-20 sometimes you just gotta keep goin' good things gotta end, but the bad's  gotta too
2020-09-21 ready  to get out there and to  make some  mistakes
2020-09-22 I am  trying out a new boot-up sequence it involves cake
2020-09-23 sometimes I forget that I have a nice collection of friends and they are nice because they are mine!
2020-09-24 I will cook something today and it may be entirely out of exhaustion and spite
2020-09-25 what new and thrilling discomforts will today bring for  me to  overcome?
2020-09-26 maybe today is just for starting up
2020-09-27 I like to create a lot of expectations for myself and I can't wait to meet one of them
2020-09-28 I  am not sure... but I think I could maybe use a hug
2020-09-29 you know it might be okay
2020-09-03 how am I doing? do you promise to believe me if I say you are doing "very  good"? doubtful but  worth a try
2020-09-30 don't always need to have somewhere to go just being here is okay too
2020-09-04 I know  there is  fun out  there! I just gotta hunt for it sometimes
2020-09-05 today I will pick a thing to not  blame my self for
2020-09-06 just  gonna take  a moment to  appreciate myself
2020-09-07 oh! I just got sad woops for some reason
2020-09-08 sometimes a proper shutdown sequence takes some practice
2020-09-09 my anxiety likes to try to help me multi-task emotions which I guess is cool... ...but maybe a little overwhelming for my taste
